[0:04:35] <2kmelo13> everybody doing ok today
[0:04:50] <modirufa6317> imo, the games are suprisingly cheap for what they're offering. My only issues currently are the inconsistant input lags
[0:04:53] <gamefan6219> yes
[0:05:28] <Project_OMEG4> Are the PS1 Resident Evil games considered retro yet? They are over 20 years old at this point.
[0:05:33] <bruhman_fromthefifthfloor> PogChamp spooky!
[0:05:33] <+Roivas1991> Spooky!
[0:05:40] <+DragonQuarter> nice hat!

[0:06:45] <unlovedhomie> ^
[0:06:46] <+opt1m4lly> one of my few favs
[0:06:46] <kNeileo> Wasn't this on NES too?
[0:06:59] <+DragonQuarter> @kNeileo yep
[0:07:03] <modirufa6317> will all games be played in this marathon?
[0:07:07] <+MiikeZillaa> my guy Spooky Whaaaaat!!!
[0:07:11] <+Roivas1991> Shame they don't have 1943 Kai on here.
[0:07:12] <gamefan6219> oops. I was wrong. Jon will be playing from 1pm to 2pm PST
[0:07:58] <Marcness1313> Reminds me of the UN Squadron lifebars. Maybe this game is where they got the idea.
[0:08:00] <kNeileo> Ohh the memories! üò≠
[0:08:02] <NumberNull> hello
[0:08:23] <+DragonQuarter> yeah I'm glad there's a life bar in this and not 1-hit kill lol
[0:08:27] <RallejoXD> Capcom give AA7 ‚òπÔ∏è
[0:09:12] <+DragonQuarter> How often do you need to use that flip manuever?
[0:10:26] <+lacquerware> eyyy
[0:10:34] <Marcness1313> I'll ask again: Are you able to play this game with the Switch (handheld mode) in Portrait mode?
[0:10:53] <logdanidis> bro thought it was a resident evil 8 showcase
[0:10:54] <+DragonQuarter> gotcha! :)
[0:11:16] <+DragonQuarter> @Marcness1313 do you mean TATE mode? It is supported.
[0:11:22] <+MadArgentinian> no AvP NotLikeThis
[0:11:38] <logdanidis> any idea when the next demo comes out? already played the maiden one
[0:11:44] <Marcness1313> Yes, I'm calling it Portrait Mode for the English-speaking peeps. :D
[0:12:17] <Marcness1313> This game IS from the "High Score" era.
[0:12:36] <+DragonQuarter> Dang I should get a flip grip
[0:12:53] <+MadArgentinian> gng free also
[0:12:56] <PaxVirtua> oh shit, its spooky
[0:13:25] <Marcness1313> It's ironic that, being from the CRT era, I don't like scanlines.
[0:14:27] <+creatinmydemise> spookyHype spookyHype spookyHype
[0:14:30] <Marcness1313> Hey, I'll dust off the Switch for this game, especially if it's free!
[0:14:42] <+Bamcc2> Sup Spooky and chat sabert14Sip
[0:15:01] <manticor5> Spooky OMG korvYes_HF spookyShock
[0:15:04] <+RagingDemon16> what up spooky, thought for a second i clicked on your stream lol
[0:15:51] <+Roivas1991> This collection has mostly shooters on here, though.

[0:18:46] <Marcness1313> Eco Fighters?
[0:19:56] <Marcness1313> Mercs?
[0:20:18] <Marcness1313> Is the list posted, instead of me calling out random titles? :D
[0:21:29] <+Roivas1991> You could check the website. It has the full list on there.
[0:21:35] <chronicthrone> Are there wallpaper customization?
[0:21:36] <Marcness1313> Apparently, Wikipedia has it broken down.
[0:21:36] <+sadisticsoldier> had the NES version of this, was a good time, but I sucked at it
[0:21:58] <manticor5> HahaSweat HahaSweat
[0:22:13] <Marcness1313> You want to struggle, finish "Ghosts 'N Goblins." Oh my.
[0:22:27] <xxsamsamgamingxx> Is there online in this game
[0:22:37] <modirufa6317> yes
[0:23:00] <bulkorelatos> yo my boy spooky??
[0:23:00] <CarcinogenSDA> howdy sp00ky
[0:23:02] <+DragonQuarter> No online play, local, but there are online leaderboards
[0:23:28] <+DragonQuarter> No online, only local* I mean
[0:23:30] <Marcness1313> If you ask me, I think most of the NES ports are better than their arcade counterparts.
[0:23:36] <+sadisticsoldier> didn't know that, but doesn't look even close to as cool as arcade version, plus can't just feel quarters in to beat it
[0:23:37] <+Roivas1991> Shame about no online multiplayer, but then again, with how they did online with SF 30th and Capcom Beat em Up Bundle, it was for the best imo.
[0:23:40] <bulkorelatos> the 1900's series are my favorite shooters
[0:23:49] <xxsamsamgamingxx> So no pvp online for Street Fighter II World Warrior
[0:23:57] <Marcness1313> Though, for shoot-em-ups, I think the arcade versions are better because of sprite limits.
[0:24:21] <Marcness1313> Yes! Mercs made the list!!
[0:24:40] <+BrenoSarkis> Does anyone know if it will be released physically?
[0:24:44] <+sadisticsoldier> big difference in sound as well
[0:24:56] <bulkorelatos> bombs have invinsibility, yes
[0:25:11] <kyokusagani1996> Yoooo happy launch day, capcom nation !! you seem like you're still on one credit !
[0:25:42] <Marcness1313> Yeah, can't beat the arcade sound chips, compared to the NES.
[0:25:58] <kyokusagani1996> good ol' FM sound. =)
[0:26:08] <TheMK90> How is Street Fighter 2? Is it performing well?
[0:26:08] <xxsamsamgamingxx> Is there Final Fight 1
[0:26:23] <kyokusagani1996> that's in the capcom beat em up bundle, a different bundle. @xxsamsamgamingxx
[0:26:30] <Marcness1313> @xxsamsamgamingxx Yeah, it's on the list.
[0:26:48] <kyokusagani1996> this has the games that predated final fight 1, like trojan ! which is really good by the way.
[0:26:50] <xxsamsamgamingxx> ok thx @marcness1313
[0:27:04] <CarcinogenSDA> hold on spooby i believe in you
[0:27:34] <Marcness1313> So, Carrier Airwing made the list, but UN Squadron didn't.
[0:27:49] <manticor5> prawnzBless_BW prawnzBless_BW
[0:27:55] <Marcness1313> 1 out of 2 ain't bad, I guess. :P
[0:28:10] <kyokusagani1996> there's also always room to add some DLC too. I mean.. if 1944 made it onto this list.. then the prophecy can still be fufiled and DIMAHOO might make it.
[0:28:17] <Marcness1313> Yup, Credit #3.
[0:28:29] <+sadisticsoldier> mighty final fight was NES only right? that game cracked me up
[0:28:43] <PIE_Sci> üëÄ
[0:28:44] <+deeleecali> some nice bullet dodges going on
[0:28:47] <bulkorelatos> @sadisticsoldier yes nes only
[0:29:06] <CarcinogenSDA> damn spooky you played this a lot
[0:29:13] <+deeleecali> @sadisticsoldier ya i played that for the first time a few years back on the NES virtual console on the WiiU it was a nice little gem and i like the parody story
[0:29:25] <+Blarcade> Is Carrier Airwing a licensed game? U.N Squadron is.
[0:29:28] <Marcness1313> 16 stages is a LOT of game!
[0:29:37] <bulkorelatos> spooky with the god like plays
[0:29:39] <kyokusagani1996> say, where would the best place be to send feedback to capcom for this pack?
[0:29:41] <xxsamsamgamingxx> Ikaruga is more harder
[0:29:43] <CarcinogenSDA> yashichi!!
[0:30:04] <+sadisticsoldier> you save her at the end with Cody and Haggar just jacks her and runs away like it was all him
[0:30:10] <Marcness1313> @Blarcade No, it's not licensed. I think CAW came out after UNS. Although, Sean Connery's likeness made it in CAW. :D
[0:30:11] <+deeleecali> @Blarcade carrier airwing is not licensed
[0:30:23] <bulkorelatos> oh, is that lifebar new? I dont recall it having one
[0:30:29] <manticor5> oh no prawnzSad_HF
[0:31:02] <kyokusagani1996> yes, it was actually a direct number in the NES version but it worked the same way.
[0:31:05] <Marcness1313> Yeah, I think I'd play these old games with an arcade stick.
[0:31:08] <moniz_inc> Numbers, yeah.
[0:31:40] <bulkorelatos> what are you playing this with?
[0:31:49] <CarcinogenSDA> man 1cc a blowup
[0:32:21] <ViniciusTsukune> fayetanYay fayetanYay fayetanYay
[0:32:32] <Marcness1313> The Fuel powerup is pretty rare, right?
[0:32:46] <+deeleecali> i have the hori capcom fightstick for the switch and was playing this last night and i love the presentation of the virtual arcade they really nailed that part of the game and the options for display and other things like rewind and speeding up the game make this a really nice package IMO
[0:32:46] <manticor5> prawnzBless_BW
[0:32:59] <King9999> wait, Spooky's on Capcom's stream? Ayyy
[0:33:09] <+deeleecali> price comes out to like $1.30 a game too so a nice deal id say
[0:33:38] <+deadstarr7> sick shout outs to spooky
[0:34:11] <+sadisticsoldier> can you swap the view? to fill the switch screen and turn it
[0:34:18] <Marcness1313> This is the "Service Area" of the trip. :D
[0:34:18] <CarcinogenSDA> imma be playing The Loop Master, I‚Äôm scared
[0:34:44] <Marcness1313> Anti carpal-tunnel stage. :D
[0:34:52] <mirascarlet> scarletLurk
[0:34:57] <+deeleecali> @sadisticsoldier yes they have vertical TATE mode available for some of the shooters
[0:35:36] <King9999> Cool, so you can play in handled mode vertically
[0:35:38] <kyokusagani1996> anyway, this collection's presentation and online functionalities are TOP NOTCH and I really wanna shower this game with praise.
[0:35:58] <mirascarlet> that's neat!
[0:35:58] <kyokusagani1996> Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about. RNG was strong in those early capcom games.
[0:36:00] <Marcness1313> RNGsus blesses this game!
[0:36:03] <CarcinogenSDA> you can tate this in handheld!?
[0:36:06] <+Roivas1991> So it's a pre-Roguelike?
[0:36:15] <+deeleecali> how many rounds is that man gonna go hes on a roll
[0:36:20] <kyokusagani1996> ghosts n goblins is infamous for being RNG heavy, and more games can actually learn from that.
[0:36:42] <kyokusagani1996> the sequel, ghouls n ghosts, kept all the randomness but tweaked it so you don't get into unfair situations like enemies spawning on top of you.
[0:36:44] <+DragonQuarter> This is going to be the first time I seriously try to beat Ghosts 'n Goblins and Ghouls 'n Ghosts. I want to do it without rewind. I'm scared o_o
[0:37:01] <CarcinogenSDA> yeah i‚Äôll be playing on a 4k tv, can‚Äôt tate lmao
[0:37:03] <kyokusagani1996> it made these early capcom games hard and exciting, you gotta be at the top of your game !
[0:37:24] <Marcness1313> Dpn
[0:37:26] <KA1R1> ka1r1Hey Sp00ks spookyCody2
[0:37:27] <kyokusagani1996> @DragonQuarter word of advice, play the japanese version, it's japan revision G on this and that's the easier version.
[0:37:38] <+deeleecali> @DragonQuarter good thing you have unlimited quarters right lol
[0:37:48] <Marcness1313> Don't give up, forearm muscles!! üí™üèΩ
[0:37:52] <Wotter16> My only critisism with the collection is Red Earth/War-Zard not being in it. Was kinda hoping that would avert the long time it had with not having a home port.
[0:37:59] <kyokusagani1996> the Japanese version DIDNT ALLOW continues originally, but you can use saves to substitute that.
[0:38:03] <Puzzlefansub> @CarcinogenSDA carciHi
[0:38:15] <CarcinogenSDA> carciHi @puzzlefansub
[0:38:20] <kyokusagani1996> Its actually easier than the US versions are due to the enemies having less hit points.
[0:38:37] <Wotter16> Besides from that, it's a very stellar line up of classics üëç
[0:39:05] <kyokusagani1996> It's tragic red earth was such a flop, if it ever returns officially my god
[0:39:07] <Wotter16> And having Progear, a CAVE game, in it sealed the deal for me
[0:39:14] <+DragonQuarter> @kyokusagani1996 noted thanks lol
[0:39:23] <Marcness1313> Wow, getting more CPSIII games would be a treat!
[0:39:32] <kyokusagani1996> Progear no arashi is huge. The only one that actually DID NOT get a legal re-release yet is dimahoo.
[0:39:53] <kyokusagani1996> If dimahoo gets released, then the prophecy will be fufiled and all non-licensed CPS2 games will be legally available. it will be amazing.
[0:40:03] <+DragonQuarter> that 1943 melody is catchy
[0:40:06] <Marcness1313> This song is like a pep rally song. :D
[0:40:20] <+sadisticsoldier> oh, they got. new red band trailer for the upcoming MK flick
[0:40:38] <Marcness1313> Wear a varsity jacket for the song!
[0:41:23] <kyokusagani1996> Anyway this is my two cents for the boys over at @CapcomUSA . The red carpet was rolled out for the rich history of these games, but the input lag in CPS2 games like giga wing needs to be fixed.
[0:41:29] <manticor5> ez pz
[0:41:49] <Wotter16> @kyokusagani1996 That's Great Mahou Daisakusen by Raizing, yeah?
[0:41:49] <+Jetman2021> Spooky?
[0:41:51] <kyokusagani1996> once that gets patched up, i'm buying all the packs because the UI is top notch and is very nostalgic.
[0:42:18] <kyokusagani1996> and thank you for taking the feedback, it will make this collection ultimate !!
[0:42:19] <+Aaronator1992> I am here for the next Host @RogersBase!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

[0:46:24] <AshSaidHi> My pleasure
[0:46:28] <berniethebul> this is actually clean
[0:47:04] <+Aaronator1992> I probably will keep this stream on after @RogersBase does this segment to help out with finishing cleaning up my apartment.
[0:47:13] <+deeleecali> nice run
[0:47:19] <Obi_Wan_Jabroni> I guess there will is a schedule, but this is dope either way. Still here for rogersbaseLove rogersbaseLove
[0:47:20] <Marcness1313> Wait, does this game run at 60fps?
[0:47:31] <+Aaronator1992> I'm taking a little break rn.
[0:48:00] <berniethebul> unrelated note: Splatoon 3 is gonna be dope!
[0:48:39] <kyokusagani1996> Yes. This game is a full 60 hertz. @Marcness1313
[0:49:00] <kyokusagani1996> arcade version's pure 60 FPS.
[0:49:00] <Danomighty> sp00ky kinda OD!! :O
[0:49:01] <+ne11ywhoa> whoa. 24 games, 24 hour
[0:49:09] <+Fronzel> Still a better soundtrack than 1942. Don't @ me
[0:49:10] <XtemmA> whats spaltoon?
[0:49:24] <Marcness1313> Some old games ran at 30fps. That's why I asked.
[0:49:54] <Marcness1313> Look at this screen, gaddang.
[0:50:01] <+DonniTTV> Put on roger!
[0:50:26] <kyokusagani1996> that was almost a one hit kill.
[0:50:59] <Danomighty> yay MERICA!!!!
[0:51:12] <+Fronzel> I played the hell out of this on the NES when I was a kid
[0:51:18] <kyokusagani1996> the slowdown is not the framerate, it's a CPU slowdown.
[0:51:25] <Marcness1313> Shoot the elephant! Extra points!
[0:51:48] <+gryphonofmight> This game was very controversial in Japan back then
[0:52:11] <kyokusagani1996> this was actually censored on the famicom, yeah @gryphonofmight it takes guts to release this unedited =)
[0:52:11] <+ShadowGeistZero> Mods keep checking my messages spookyPlz spookyPlz Spoopy tell them I‚Äôm aight LUL
[0:52:15] <SaikyoStyle> üá∫üá∏
[0:53:16] <King9999> Probably a case by case thing
[0:53:16] <Marcness1313> Oh yeah, Street Fighter Rainbow Edition!
[0:54:10] <SaikyoStyle> Sf2 Koryu LUL
[0:54:19] <kyokusagani1996> the crappy bootleg that inspired capcom to make one of the best video games ever made ! @Marcness1313 LONG LIVE street fighter 2 turbo !!
[0:54:25] <King9999> Wait, Rainbow edition is in this?
[0:54:35] <SaikyoStyle> No
[0:54:39] <Wotter16> @King9999 no lol
[0:54:49] <kyokusagani1996> of course not, no crap games here. Only good games allowed. =) @King9999
[0:54:51] <King9999> ok lol.
[0:54:56] <+Fronzel> Which game has the best soundtrack?
[0:55:18] <King9999> Chat was scaring me for a moment lol
[0:55:20] <Wotter16> Besides, Rainbow Edition is an unauthorized ROM Hack :V
[0:55:20] <+gryphonofmight> @kyokusagani1996 and censored in the west also
[0:55:31] <Obi_Wan_Jabroni> This game is dope, I haven't played this kind of game in so long so it's satisfying watching this right now.
[0:55:34] <SaikyoStyle> spookyDollars
[0:55:54] <kyokusagani1996> i'd say Ghouls N ghosts has one of the most epic soundtracks on this collection !
[0:56:14] <kyokusagani1996> that's the CPS1 at its finest !
[0:56:39] <King9999> Old psycho crusher was busted
[0:56:58] <kyokusagani1996> champion edition is still a darn good game today !
[0:57:15] <NMario84> Yea, WW Psycho crusher only does 1 Hit as well, where CE did multiple hits if guarded
[0:57:21] <kyokusagani1996> that game is still relatively well balanced and is the handbook for learning fighting games !
[0:57:24] <Wotter16> That being said tho, Rainbow Edition did inspire Capcom to bring SFII Hyper Fighting to fruition
[0:58:40] <Marcness1313> Hyper Fighting was Capcom taking back the power from Rainbow or Black Belt Edition.

[1:43:13] <mirascarlet> @BlackwingKei I agree with that for sure! allows you to try different things and see different results!
[1:43:15] <PureYeti> Lol I forgot there is a rewind feature
[1:43:23] <Marcness1313> Pausing the game during the match forfeits the match. :D
[1:43:25] <jgolden4> Seriously, this is making me laugh so much right now!
[1:43:32] <+LightusX_OG> I thought that was stun
[1:43:46] <Obi_Wan_Jabroni> @mirascarlet right? and it's not so broken that you win every time, you really do have to work for it
[1:43:51] <PureYeti> Dang Balrog didn‚Äôt want to finish

[1:43:52] <+LightusX_OG> Damn Balrogs Punch is brutal
[1:43:52] <PHboyu> hes as strong as zangief but hes a bit slower and has charge attacks

[1:45:54] <+deeleecali> @xbs2034 Ultra SF2 is definitely more fair with the CPU AI because these older games had AI that could read your moves or pull off special moves without charging for example
[1:45:54] <AshSaidHi> @linkusama ILY
[1:45:57] <Obi_Wan_Jabroni> Don't you know you have to force balrog to use aerials, they're not good Kappa

[1:48:13] <+deeleecali> he has the option to map the 3 button press lariat to a single button if he wants. that would definitely help

[1:49:37] <+Aaronator1992> even with the mask its just PERFECT
[1:49:47] <jgolden4> If Vega‚Äôs so handsome, then why does he hide behind a mask?

[3:11:20] <raizer_wolf> The Deleter!

[3:11:42] <+justkingdion> I'm sorry, what are those background dudes
[3:11:49] <KyrashiDraconis> PECK THEM, OSTRICH!
[3:11:50] <Tokoshoran> Maybe Ostrich is the kid and Pink is the ostrich, or vice-versa?
[3:11:52] <+Wolv022> Honestly, shenanigans here will likely be *sub-standard* compared to shenanigan levels in a normal stream
[3:12:05] <chronicthrone> first time in the west?
[3:12:14] <kronosgear8745> hi jon
[3:12:17] <kitestar> is this the human condition known as "madness", leader? leader: "indeed"
[3:12:28] <joeygatorman> Giga Wing, really?
[3:12:30] <epodi7> this is what the 90s thought that the future would be like
[3:12:42] <Dungeon00X> It's still missing Eco Fighters
[3:12:46] <Tokoshoran> Huh, looked it up, the kid's name is Pola, so Pink Ostrich is the Ostrich's full name.
[3:12:47] <+Roivas1991> I'm more surprised that they got Progear, a Cave game on here.
[3:12:48] <joeygatorman> The Trillion Point Game
[3:12:50] <+TygerTyger413> I just noticed that the green robots Jon is beating up are called R.O.B.

[3:12:56] <cyankee78> I just came by to say, SF6 better have good netcode.
[3:13:05] <PureYeti> It need some more darkstalkers

[3:14:41] <Professor_Mitchell> And he turned fat
[3:14:47] <Chaosking1236> he was fat?! protonBaka
[3:14:49] <Dungeon00X> I guess nobody cares about Eco Fighters
[3:14:50] <KyrashiDraconis> @Wolv022 Ah, the famoous motto of the Mythbusters...
[3:14:52] <+Xero_J> I prefer Swift Sparrow. Haha, FEH humor

[3:15:30] <+TygerTyger413> Does that ostrich have teeth? the8bitWot
[3:15:38] <Gameface252> Just walked away

[3:15:47] <+DamonKatumaru> Villains act, Heroes React
[3:15:48] <Moist_Cronchy_Potato> @CrimsonDragoon23 yeah, it is
[3:15:48] <Professor_Mitchell> The one, the only, Proton Jon.
[3:15:49] <Tenmar> One of the fringe benefits of being a villain. You don't have to do anything.
[3:16:00] <epodi7> i REALLY wish you could turn off the flashing lights in this collection.
[3:16:02] <redxparasite> protonEgg
[3:16:13] <+kingkarnage1315> Then it wouldn‚Äôt be a death blow
[3:16:14] <+Wolv022> Wait wait wait, Capcom put out DnD games?
[3:16:20] <DrZock> That's ALIEN GREEN, the plant monster who has the healing ability
[3:16:38] <CrimsonDragoon23> I usually play either Iris or Capitan Blue in this.
[3:16:38] <Danomighty> wtffff?? new game?
[3:16:39] <+AmephEstMako> HE HAS A GIANT BRAIN! He is HISTORY'S GREATEST MONSTER!
[3:16:40] <Dungeon00X> Hey, anybody remember the Capcom Beat Em Up bundle they released with horrible online multiplayer?
[3:16:43] <+Roivas1991> Now I want those D&D games on Switch...
[3:16:49] <TheManiacalGamer> I appreciate the giant pink ostritch
[3:17:08] <+KatanaBalls> pink ostritch vs black elephant, a fight of the century
[3:17:09] <PureYeti> @dungeon00x I got it but I didn‚Äôt touch online
[3:17:20] <KyrashiDraconis> protonFinish DING DING DING
[3:17:34] <Professor_Mitchell> @Roivas1991 They are on Switch.
[3:17:37] <epodi7> that butt shot though
[3:17:44] <Jam_Cop> Play a mini-game!
[3:17:55] <Professor_Mitchell> I think.
[3:17:57] <Dungeon00X> @Danomighty ?????
[3:18:01] <Tokoshoran> Pink is real hype for Small Child shooting this tank.
[3:18:11] <+Roivas1991> Shadows Over Mystara's on Switch?
[3:18:25] <Tenmar> So how is your day ProtonJon?
[3:18:26] <TheManiacalGamer> so kind of like the pizzas in sewer surfing in turtles in time
[3:18:26] <joeygatorman> Sweet, extra life.
[3:18:36] <+ddtraveler> So I just got here and there's a pink ostrich with an eyepatch on a hovercraft.
[3:18:39] <Jolteron> Wheeeeeeeeee!
[3:18:51] <+Roivas1991> I was talking about the D&D beat em ups.
[3:19:00] <DrZock> As you do
[3:19:00] <CrimsonDragoon23> @roivas1991 No, unfortunately. Really hoping they put out a 4th pack with D&D games, along with a bunch of other licensed games. I'd gladly pay $30 for it.
[3:19:01] <+PhillipHo_39> On land!?
[3:19:07] <Jam_Cop> All the bosses are good at splits apparently
[3:19:08] <KyrashiDraconis> @ddtraveler Yeah, Jon considered the Ostrich the most badass of all the options...
[3:19:09] <+Minne91> As it should
[3:19:09] <+ddtraveler> As you do.
[3:19:12] <+Culex77> Y'know as you do
[3:19:28] <Tenmar> Shout outs to the person who wrote "I love you Barb "in the sand
[3:19:29] <TheManiacalGamer> i appreciate the "I love Barbara" writing in the sand
[3:19:30] <kitsuonce> What's written in the sand there?
[3:19:30] <+ddtraveler> @KyrashiDraconis Fair enough.
[3:19:34] <Dungeon00X> @PureYeti It is super laggy and it had some of the titles in this collection.
[3:19:34] <epodi7> @Roivas1991 yeah, pretty sure they aren't on Switch, but they are on Steam

[3:21:24] <TheManiacalGamer> Being able to take over the world with less powerful computers is impressive in its own right
[3:21:32] <SuperIcee> 1997, so everything would be running at MOST Windows 98.
[3:21:33] <+PhillipHo_39> You know, Jon, you're not wrong there! Suddenly getting Terminator vibes.
[3:21:36] <+ddtraveler> And by sneak in they mean kick everyone with an ostrich.
[3:21:37] <Tokoshoran> But all computers run on Windows. What are these Linux and Macintosh you're talking about?
[3:21:42] <+Wolv022> Skynet, which, as we all know, can only be defeated by a pink otrich.
[3:21:42] <DrZock> NOBODY EXPECTS THE OSTRICH INQUISITION!
[3:21:43] <+James_KT> TheIlluminati

[3:21:56] <KyrashiDraconis> @PhillipHo_39 So when do we meet the time-travelers?

[3:25:37] <SunsetJack> Do you scream Jessica?
[3:25:38] <+PresidentDog> he can uppercut and makes tornadoes!
[3:25:38] <DrZock> Look! They're manufacturing lizard men in the background!
[3:25:39] <Guindimere> Proton Cody, yeah I can see it
[3:25:40] <+ddtraveler> Superpowers: Has knife, becomes mayor.
[3:25:40] <smashbreault> Proton Mayor
[3:25:41] <DarkOverord> Sorry Jon, you're Cody if you buy a knife
[3:25:44] <manticor5> spookyCody
[3:25:46] <+KatanaBalls> ProtonCody in the house
[3:25:46] <diggydiglett> That‚Äôs a good point
[3:25:49] <Tenmar> The lesson of this stream is to buy a knife and then you can become Mayor?
[3:25:49] <+Culex77> I mean you can only go up after going to jail
[3:25:50] <MajorMooch> But he's not Mayor of the World.
[3:25:52] <TheManiacalGamer> Guy only gives you Profound Sadness
[3:25:56] <+Roivas1991> lol Seems weird that his V-Triggers in SFV are him wielding a knife or a pipe.
[3:25:58] <+adamdotpng> shasKnife
[3:25:59] <Moist_Cronchy_Potato> The lesson here is, if you buy a knife, you eventually become mayor.
[3:26:00] <+ProofGold> We gonna fight in Street Fighter later
[3:26:01] <Professor_Mitchell> Now this is a knife. Good day!
[3:26:04] <+Minne91> Aww I was just about to head to Bed Bath and Beyond...
[3:26:05] <PhilipDraco> Unless you need one for cookie class
[3:26:06] <+DamonKatumaru> Jon has a lot of alts.
[3:26:07] <DragonLord_Carter> Unless you need a new one for your kitchen -- a good kitchen knife will last you a while.
[3:26:09] <Tenmar> Man the job requirements for a mayor are low these days...
[3:26:10] <+TygerTyger413> Does it not scale for number of players?
[3:26:10] <ElectricVideoGamer> Did you just Crack Shoot?!
[3:26:10] <+justkingdion> I mean, buy a knife if you don't have one. always good to have one on hand
[3:26:11] <kitsuonce> what if I already own a knife?
[3:26:20] <epodi7> unless it's a Kitchen knife for cooking. that's fine
[3:26:21] <+Xero_J> He‚Äôs also apparently able to fight evenly with Oni, which is literally Super Akamai
[3:26:24] <+PhillipHo_39> 60 Seconds!?
[3:26:26] <SuperVeryman> Cody is powerful character in all of street fighter lore but he's just lazy.
[3:26:27] <+Ty_Cyan> i thought Haggar becomes mayor
[3:26:27] <+Culex77> That flip kick he did seemed...VERY much like Terry's Flash Kick
[3:26:28] <smashbreault> But I need a knife to slice some pieces of Beefuru! D:
[3:26:31] <SirShup> shedMald
[3:26:37] <Draxion23> this seems like a good game
[3:26:38] <TheManiacalGamer> sometimes games become real obscure and its a shame as you can find some real hidden gems
[3:26:42] <LundeaDeRune> This game also was Japan and Europe only, Jon, so that's also why you didn't hear of it
[3:26:43] <Tenmar> Look, where is my Alien Vs Predator beat em up Capcom?
[3:26:44] <Jam_Cop> the8bitSmile
[3:26:46] <+Inriri> Still sad Alien vs Predator is stuck on that 250 dollar stick

[3:26:55] <Smxsonic> I came for the Disk, Only
[3:27:00] <ReploidArmada> Octopus II! Do not steal!
[3:27:01] <+Roivas1991> I heard of this, but Battle Circuit never made it to North America until the Beat em Up Bundle.
[3:27:04] <Tenmar> Power down!
[3:27:05] <Jam_Cop> PrideLaugh
[3:27:07] <+ProofGold> Eh, prefer Octopus 3
[3:27:14] <AlextricGuy> the robots face looks like garfield

[3:27:18] <MidoriTori7> @Tenmar was that made by capcom?
[3:27:28] <+ddtraveler> I was about to shout "No Jon, it's a trap!" Did not expect it to actually be a trap.
[3:27:31] <+Inriri> Did Treasure make this boss?
[3:27:41] <+Culex77> I just realized I called Crack Shoot Flash Kick
[3:27:43] <+Wolv022> First rocks, now bombs, I feel like these guys know you'll walk into traps for money
[3:27:46] <Tenmar> It was @MidoriTori7
[3:27:48] <+PhillipHo_39> UFO, come back!!!!
[3:27:53] <TheTrollingShuckle> protonRaid
[3:27:54] <Professor_Mitchell> The boss is apparently steam powered. Look at those steam whistles.
[3:28:01] <+Culex77> That's a Guile thing you crazy me

[3:50:33] <Tokoshoran> It's Asura. She gets stronger, thus healed, when she sees her family fall.
[3:50:35] <epodi7> Green kinds sucks...
[3:50:38] <auraguardian98> ASURA‚ÄôS WRATH!
[3:50:43] <BadRoad> Now you have to face Asura's wrath.
[3:50:47] <+ddtraveler> I love that "Puny god" is a move.
[3:51:07] <RUBICN64> A*Green for latest Smash DLC
[3:51:08] <+TygerTyger413> No no, it broke BECAUSE you were slamming Barbara and her family into the ground.
[3:51:09] <diggydiglett> Huh?
[3:51:14] <+PhillipHo_39> How did Dr. Saturn even escape from prison?
[3:51:18] <Ragnarakk> I love that you're using a different pronounciation each time
[3:51:22] <KyrashiDraconis> PFFT~ the8bitLUL protonLOL
[3:51:24] <pantaro> Time to give his head more craters.
[3:51:25] <+ddtraveler> Is that Octopus II again?
[3:51:25] <blake646464> Don't get too cocky sStar Fox
[3:51:27] <JeyJ24> HahaReindeer
[3:51:27] <+Culex77> Of course he made a third one
[3:51:29] <HiroProtagonest> Any relation to Mr. Saturn?
[3:51:30] <Cerulean16> "how many times do we gotta teach you this lesson old man?!"
[3:51:37] <dr_prima> is it Comming as a visical version???!?!?!
[3:51:55] <redxparasite> What do you have against octopuses named Mark? Kappa
[3:51:57] <+ddtraveler> Mark 1 didn't work out.
[3:52:00] <+Culex77> I agree. What happened to the first one?
[3:52:02] <astrela1> EGG
[3:52:02] <blake646464> Flashing Lights
[3:52:06] <+TheOneCalledStu> maybe the mark 1 failed and didnt leave the proto typing stage
[3:52:12] <BadRoad> Mark 1 is the prototype, mark 2 is the production model.
[3:52:13] <Professor_Mitchell> Oh hai, Mark Three.
[3:52:24] <PhilipDraco> ...That looks a LOT like the Mean Machine from Wacky Races.
[3:52:34] <blackknightax> I like that it's a beat em up with a plant thing protag
[3:52:39] <KyrashiDraconis> Speaking of which, why didn't they reinforce their Black Elephant after the last few levels of shenanigans? Or did they reinforce the Octopus that much more that the vehicle can't take the weight?
[3:52:55] <+DamonKatumaru> My guess is Limited Run
[3:53:05] <dr_prima> oeh nice i hope so
[3:53:08] <JkZr0> So has Green.

[4:23:16] <+shiplord13> Protonjared was so upset not getting the secret level. Maybe he is watching this feeling better about his abilties
[4:23:26] <sweetestbeefs> @skylerpilot nah, he just waves the smoke away cuz he hates the smell
[4:23:32] <CommanderSqueaks> I love it when Pat rewinds the game .5 seconds and dies the same exact way 5 times in a row.

[4:39:25] <Jaxnos> why do half of these guy have the super mushroom powerup?
[4:39:43] <SoFarFetched> Imagine how many quarters you'd be going through.
[4:39:52] <Jessie_Lockhart> They ate their Wheaties

[4:40:30] <IndoorSitup> @thegiantenemycrab Chill dude
[4:40:31] <+Midashu> Dark Void was a weird game
[4:40:36] <MrBaconJam> Nah Pat, these are clearly easy baby games Kappa
[4:40:38] <CommanderSqueaks> Oh no, is old man Pat talking about the war again?
[4:40:39] <+Inriri> You remember the cool costume the guy had
[4:40:41] <+Ninjacostar> lol this am out auto bot is a idea
[4:40:43] <+CaptainDonk> Remember Dark Void Zero
[4:40:51] <marvel877> And Dark Void Zero is stuck on the DSi eshop, which is dead and buried.
[4:40:51] <DrZock> I remember Dark Void ZERO, but not the actual Dark Void
[4:40:52] <RetroCop87> my wife is my AAARRRRMMMM
[4:40:53] <SpiKy_Peacemaker> thiis look like some serious old school :D

[4:41:13] <+Excessumamyamy> time monkaS
[4:41:22] <CommanderSqueaks> He's gonna start talking about the old Monster Hunter ui soon.
[4:41:28] <IndoorSitup> "Just run" seems like a good strategy fkr this game.
[4:41:32] <+Inriri> This has better rollback than SFV
[4:41:34] <+TheGiantEnemyCrab> @PureYeti You aren't the Capcom USA community manager.
[4:41:44] <LVDoomien> back in Pat's day he had to go up and down a hill in the snow to craft a mega potion
[4:42:07] <DrZock> THAT'S what this reminds me of - Metal Man's theme from MM2
[4:42:09] <deviljhojho_> never backdown king
[4:42:17] <+Midashu> can't you deflect bullets with your grapple arm?
[4:42:22] <LordLicoriceDerp> this game is crazy horseshit
[4:42:27] <+Excessumamyamy> doogDance

[4:42:37] <+Inriri> The ol' "We need more quarters" section
[4:42:45] <BalloniWright> he's gonna break it again PogChamp
[4:43:09] <+Excessumamyamy> cirLaugh Pat
[4:43:17] <SoFarFetched> @TheGiantEnemyCrab This is probably considered a "completed" product for now. Unless they otherwise state, "hey we will adding more games in the future".
[4:43:19] <CommanderSqueaks> There is too much going on in this part.
[4:43:28] <+slimmixrp> S a v e
[4:43:33] <IndoorSitup> Imagine how many quaters Pat would had to have spent in order to even get to this point back in the day
[4:43:35] <DedlokPM> FIRST TRY
[4:43:35] <@Moobot> The Capcom Arcade Stadium Retro Marathon is running from 10 AM to 10 PM Pacific February 18th and 19th! Schedule: http://bit.ly/3ue6miv
[4:43:37] <+Valis77> yes back then when games was GAMING
[4:43:37] <devanmuse> and that was only level FOUR?
[4:43:38] <SuckerPunchSyd> Woo!
[4:43:39] <LVDoomien> poor Fetched is moderating and she isn't even on duty
[4:43:42] <projectrad> FIRST TRY
[4:43:47] <sweetestbeefs> at least 10 dollars in quarters
[4:43:50] <+Excessumamyamy> doogYay doogYay doogYay
[4:43:52] <Xelhesia> 35
[4:43:53] <+Inriri> Where's the Gief
[4:43:55] <DedlokPM> Couple hundred dollars*
[4:43:56] <+shiplord13> You should be at around $100
[4:44:26] <sweetestbeefs> dementia hits hard
[4:44:30] <+Jekado> Tower of doom is the old one
[4:44:31] <CommanderSqueaks> I think the only arcade game I ever beat for realsie was Metal Slug X, and it was at a nickel arcade. Still spend about $5
[4:44:51] <+Jekado> Mystaria is the newer one
[4:45:07] <+CaptainDonk> I beat SFA when someone walked away after putting like 20 bucks in quarters lol
[4:45:11] <Jaxnos> for true
[4:45:12] <+Excessumamyamy> 4Real ? :)
[4:45:15] <LVDoomien> vehicular homicide via helicopter
[4:45:18] <+Jekado> Tower i think only had 4 playable characters while Mystaria had splitting paths and several characters.
[4:45:25] <DrZock> This game is like 4D chess
[4:45:28] <sweetestbeefs> I remember beating the turtles in time arcade with my buddies, we all had like 20 bucks to spare and it was a fun time
[4:45:28] <+CaptainDonk> They were not happy when they came back :U
[4:45:32] <Cerulean16> *Ryuji voice* for real?
[4:45:33] <Jessie_Lockhart> Beat Mystara once a year every year for like a decade. Was a tradition everytime I visited Santa Cruz Boardwalk.

[5:01:16] <Jessie_Lockhart> @commandersqueaks this was a lot of arcade games in the 80s. We grew up with anxiety dampening cushions to our brains.

[5:14:06] <@Moobot> The Capcom Arcade Stadium Retro Marathon is running from 10 AM to 10 PM Pacific February 18th and 19th! Schedule: http://bit.ly/3ue6miv
[5:15:54] <scutoidtherapy> THATS MY BOY LUIS
[5:18:50] <flumestradamus> I wish capcom would re-release more of their 90s arcade games
[5:19:05] <kyokusagani1996> AAHHHHH yes. I am so glad I made it back here just in time for Trojan !!
[5:19:28] <kyokusagani1996> Trojan is by far one of the most brutal battles of your life. Do you wanna know a major strategy for this fight????
[5:20:25] <kyokusagani1996> go to the opposite side of where the gremlin is, and swing your sword at the edge of the screen. the hitbox will actually go to the other side of the screen. =)
[5:21:09] <D_The_Chemist> i remember Trojan at the arcade and on NES. id like to see a remake of this game
[5:21:59] <kyokusagani1996> dang rng with him jumping back. heh. these are true to the arcade originals.
[5:22:53] <kyokusagani1996> I consider this game just as important as say, kung fu master and other beat em ups because this is the first beat em up with a block button. Capcom did real innovation here and the apocalypse theme is great too.
[5:24:20] <kyokusagani1996> I've 1CC'd this one for a good reason. this is one of the few games in this collection i've 1CC'd.
[5:24:20] <@Moobot> Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection launches on February 25th! Classic challenge meets picture-book visuals in the return of a classic franchise. Pre-order today: http://bit.ly/GnGReShop
[5:25:31] <kyokusagani1996> the world record for this game's 1,643,150 points, and I can't wait to see the top replays with arcade stadium replays .
[5:26:26] <kyokusagani1996> i'd imagine the achivements / trophies will be on the PS4 / steam versions later.
[5:27:58] <+skinkskinkdead> this is going well mousieMrfrog
[5:28:25] <kyokusagani1996> this is also the Japanese version too, so the damage on everything's higher.
[5:28:34] <+skinkskinkdead> do it. boss timeee
[5:28:58] <+skinkskinkdead> even with slow mo there is nothing but pain
[5:30:07] <tomas8980> ola
[5:30:14] <kyokusagani1996> this fight is one of the easier ones actually. you poke him then walk back immediately. he stands still while he's' flailing around.
[5:30:48] <kyokusagani1996> jumping is a good idea too for extra movement speed.
[5:31:34] <kyokusagani1996> okay, it was poke and jump back.
[5:31:41] <+skinkskinkdead> try one poke then move back
[5:32:35] <kyokusagani1996> THERE YA GO
[5:32:51] <+skinkskinkdead> i would love to see you black dark souls luis
[5:32:55] <kyokusagani1996> thats the strat, its consistent once you get the timing down =)
[5:33:20] <+skinkskinkdead> *doubt*
[5:33:35] <DenT4F> Dark Souls is easy compared to this
[5:33:55] <kyokusagani1996> @DenT4F yo dent the capcom fan! what up?? I been helping this guy out for a while now.
[5:34:15] <DenT4F> sup kyo o/
[5:34:18] <kyokusagani1996> You got a checkpoint after you beat that boss so you can feel free to die and get your health back now.
[5:34:48] <kyokusagani1996> minus is start.
[5:34:49] <@Moobot> Capcom Arcade Stadium is available now for Nintendo Switch! 1943: The Battle of Midway is included for free, and grab Ghosts 'n Goblins as a free download up until the release of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection on February 25! Download now: https://gs.capcomusa.net/c/5f3xns
[5:34:50] <+skinkskinkdead> game overrr
[5:35:48] <kyokusagani1996> no you are at the checkpoint.
[5:36:11] <+skinkskinkdead> more pain spiders
[5:36:32] <kyokusagani1996> I just rush through spider rooms as fast as possible, usually that's the right thing to do to mitigate the RNG.
[5:37:32] <kyokusagani1996> If you were very young, you would PROBABLY have it easier than this.
[5:37:53] <kyokusagani1996> the USA version of this game actually halved all the damage you take from everything so everything usually only does one hit point.
[5:37:56] <AshSaidHi> hi Luis!!
[5:38:14] <kyokusagani1996> NES version came out a year later in 1987.
[5:38:17] <AshSaidHi> GL!!
[5:38:41] <Xerotheory627> cheating ass
[5:39:02] <kyokusagani1996> he will need it ! There is a luck boss in this @AshSaidHi
[5:39:26] <kyokusagani1996> although the amount of required luck is NOT as much as ghosts n goblins unless you are going for 2 loops.
[5:39:41] <AshSaidHi> @kyokusagani1996 oh man thats rough haha
[5:40:39] <kyokusagani1996> I should do a video on the version history of ghosts n goblins. that's a fascinating part of capcom history with how they did thier best to balance a really hard game.
[5:40:59] <kyokusagani1996> trojan has 6 stages and 2 loops.
[5:42:17] <kyokusagani1996> yup after you beat this guy, you're halfway done.
[5:42:36] <+deeleecali> BODIED
[5:42:38] <kyokusagani1996> this is another checkpoint by the way.
[5:42:38] <+skinkskinkdead> big brain spam strats
[5:42:57] <AshSaidHi> I love the rewind feature
[5:43:12] <+skinkskinkdead> thanks alexa, very epic
[5:44:49] <kyokusagani1996> go back.

[5:44:52] <don_thenintendofreak99> I wish the games weren't buy this to play but hey business is business LUL
[5:44:52] <DenT4F> back to jump
[5:45:27] <kyokusagani1996> OH WOW. that's insaie. I didn't even realize that you can select from the different capcom cabinets.
[5:45:47] <kyokusagani1996> capcom manufactured several cabinets back in the day , I did not expect the capcom cute to be represented here ! THATS INSANE PRESERVATION.
[5:47:03] <DenT4F> the arcade games can be learned and cleared on 1 credit. Just takes skills, patience and dedication dent4fDog
[5:47:24] <kyokusagani1996> and in this case, a little luck too.
[5:47:56] <don_thenintendofreak99> @CapcomUSA Wait Ghost n Goblins is Free?!?!?!?!
[5:48:10] <kyokusagani1996> I've pulled it off like I mentioned before, it ain't easy but it's doable.
[5:48:30] <+makeyourownfun> @don_thenintendofreak99 i think if you download the free pack it is right now
[5:48:44] <DenT4F> not sure you're allowed or able to answer this but does Capcom intend to keep adding games as DLC to Stadium? The library is so vast.. would be nice to see games that never got ported yet
[5:48:52] <ProtonJon> You gotta go to that Open square again, then walk back to the Jump button.
[5:48:56] <kyokusagani1996> you just softlocked yourself, you had to hit that open switch and then go back.
[5:49:17] <kyokusagani1996> so many cool people showing up here, nice to see you live! @ProtonJon
[5:49:28] <don_thenintendofreak99> Also Ghost n goblins on NES is the absolute hardest NES game i have ever played in my life
[5:49:58] <don_thenintendofreak99> The fact that i got to the second level is an achievement i had to use savestates when using NES Online tbh XD
[5:50:27] <kyokusagani1996> let's just say that version had issues. the arcade version's easier and most importantly controls better. @don_thenintendofreak99
[5:50:48] <don_thenintendofreak99> @kyokusagani1996 that is good to know
[5:51:32] <don_thenintendofreak99> its Zein Gief!!!!
[5:52:03] <kyokusagani1996> that might be an idea for a future version of capcom arcade cabinet actually ! @don_thenintendofreak99 I'd love to see the different revisions of GNG in there too for a 120% complete collection.
[5:52:32] <ProtonJon> It's a Boss Rush, baby!
[5:53:25] <don_thenintendofreak99> I suck at GNG tbh but i am gonna play the arcade to see how it is. As we speak it is being downloaded currently
[5:54:07] <jaylenngaming83> Hi
[5:54:14] <kyokusagani1996> by all means ghosts n goblins is fantastic! it pushed the bar for visuals in 1985, and it came out the same time as mario !
[5:54:32] <DrakeF> I'm just dabbling with 1943 atm...I'm right there with you at stinking at GnG @don_thenintendofreak99
[5:54:34] <don_thenintendofreak99> @ProtonJon I like how your pfp is Ryu from Ninja Gaiden btw
[5:54:35] <jaylenngaming83> How r u
[5:54:57] <Naleb> @kyokusagani1996 yeah just random shit, avgn played GnG before mario 1 the first day of his NES
[5:54:57] <@Moobot> Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection launches on February 25th! Classic challenge meets picture-book visuals in the return of a classic franchise. Pre-order today: http://bit.ly/GnGReShop
[5:55:16] <don_thenintendofreak99> The only capcom game i was good at was Classic Mega Man honestly LUL
[5:55:29] <jaylenngaming83> Ohh aahh
[5:55:37] <Naleb> Avgn is def yt nostalgia
[5:55:48] <don_thenintendofreak99> though tbh it would be cool if Mega Man was originally going to be an arcade game.
[5:55:50] <+starrich55> So you can rewind for this collection
[5:55:56] <ProtonJon> @don_thenintendofreak99 Haha, thanks. I love Ninja Gaiden.
[5:56:04] <kyokusagani1996> @Naleb wonder if he ever got to play the superior arcade version in his youth? he must have been wowed by it.
[5:56:14] <don_thenintendofreak99> I am still shocked that There was a Tiger Electronics Mega Man device.
[5:56:17] <Naleb> @don_thenintendofreak99 Megaman arcade aint that good anyway, the versus one
[5:56:19] <DrakeF> It's why we always kill Ryu with kindness (and bullets)
[5:56:44] <Naleb> @kyokusagani1996 next week man, our time as come to play the new switch version that look amazinh
[5:57:03] <kyokusagani1996> heck yeah dude. Ghosts n goblins resurrection is gonna be fire.
[5:57:14] <Naleb> I was streaming sGnG on jtv 15 years ago lol
[5:57:24] <kyokusagani1996> lets see where the checkpoint put you.
[5:57:31] <don_thenintendofreak99> oh wait Mega Man Arcade was a thing i forgot. tbh i am 21 I wasn't even born when Mega Man 1 came out
[5:57:54] <kyokusagani1996> @don_thenintendofreak99 I actually love mega man arcade because it incorporated all the mega man x improvements but that's just my opinion.
[5:57:55] <Naleb> @don_thenintendofreak99 yeah there are two megaman arcade game that are not that good imo
[5:58:19] <Naleb> I agree to disagree @kyokusagani1996 my friends its all love
[5:58:20] <kyokusagani1996> @Naleb what I really loved about the power battle is that you had all your mega man x moves in classic mega man which felt amazing.
[5:58:36] <don_thenintendofreak99> my favorite Mega Man game would be a tie breaker between 2, 3 and 10
[5:58:41] <kyokusagani1996> indeed. =)
[5:58:44] <cute_mega_ampharos> ipkSip
[5:59:02] <kyokusagani1996> My favorite mega man of all time Is mega man x4.
[5:59:23] <don_thenintendofreak99> Mega Man X is the only X game i could beat
[5:59:36] <Naleb> #fgc adult chat are the best :P
[5:59:42] <kyokusagani1996> I beat all the x-games from x1 to x6.
[5:59:45] <don_thenintendofreak99> all the other X games i have played i was bad at.
[6:00:02] <kyokusagani1996> but I'm not sure if you'd count ultimate armor as beating x6.
[6:00:04] <CrimsonDragoon23> Is there a schedule for who's gonna be on, and what games they'll be playing???
[6:00:22] <PureYeti> @crimsondragoon23 yea there is

[6:32:57] <PureYeti> @kyokusagani1996 oh really? Even better
[6:32:58] <+Universal_Bojack> is the resurrection one, the one from the psp? looks like it
[6:33:05] <don_thenintendofreak99> I got through the first level and i used rewind yes but i am happy i can choose to put it on Easy Mode
[6:33:07] <kyokusagani1996> Ghouls n ghosts is hard, but it's FAIRER.

[6:33:27] <kyokusagani1996> that's what you're looking for. you have the original game which is hard as heck, and then the sequel which is hard but Fairer.
[6:33:30] <PureYeti> @universal_bojack it‚Äôs different than the psp
[6:33:35] <ProtonJon> Feb 25th for Resurrection. It looks like it's a remake of the second arcade game/the Genesis game. Believe the PSP game was it's own game.
[6:33:38] <Djief> it would look like this but with no dying thabDerp

[6:34:00] <kyokusagani1996> @Djief actually it wouldn't. the bullets would be faster on a no death run.
[6:34:06] <PureYeti> I‚Äôm surprise Capcom have their own version of this

[6:34:13] <Djief> LUL fair
[6:34:13] <+hugsSissy> Djief bringing the wisdom as usual LUL
[6:34:20] <kyokusagani1996> there is rank / dynamic difficulty in this game.
[6:34:28] <+YellowChikorita> that strategy worked LUL
[6:34:37] <+Universal_Bojack> that's what you have to do, just watch your ship only
[6:34:42] <BrysonHart3086> I would last 5 seconds
[6:34:44] <WaitingForPie> "watch yourself" that's a good life strategy Kappa
[6:34:46] <kyokusagani1996> the bullet speed increases if you go a level without dying, and it locks for the whole game once you die anywhere in this game.
[6:34:52] <Djief> yeah I forgot about that part kyokusagani1996 I haven't played this in forever LUL
[6:35:10] <doomtek_99> Love this! hoping Giga Wing 2 can on there too.

[7:42:14] <SirShup> Used both handguns and pistol whipped the player 1 & 2 buttons when I ran out of lives
[7:42:18] <solstrider3> it's not slow down either; they are fps drops and it is more noticeable when using the arcade frame backgrounds

[8:16:02] <DiskCart> I hope this might get a physical release. theres a lot of good play here
[8:16:28] <+number1spiderman3fan> I think there's evidence that the NES version was being developed before the arcade version anyway, right? They're both based on a manga. The arcade version takes a lot more liberties with the source material.
[8:16:28] <+baysam2> how many games come in this
[8:16:51] <DragonLord_Carter> 1943: Battle of Midway is the always-free included game.

[8:17:54] <kyokusagani1996> you buy the other games in game packs, so you can either get them all at a discount or buy the ones you want to play specificly. @starbolt89
[8:18:20] <don_thenintendofreak99> I have a question to ask Mylifeingaming and i do apologize that i repeated the question it is a 2 part question
[8:18:20] <DiskCart> Is there any perceivable input lag on these? if anyones given them a go?
[8:18:24] <+CerebraPod570> wow
[8:18:40] <kyokusagani1996> @DiskCart capcom's aware of it and they're working on a fix for giga wing.
[8:19:11] <DiskCart> @kyokusagani1996 fair enough. glad they went straight to fixin stuff
[8:19:33] <+DragonQuarter> Coury and Try, heck yeah
[8:20:20] <geraldtjy> Never knew strider can go Super Saiyan
[8:20:35] <+Zeutral89> 2021, year of the Dragon, Try
[8:20:35] <+DragonQuarter> DQ is very divisive but I love it. My favorite is Breath of Fire II though :)
[8:20:38] <kyokusagani1996> once that patch comes out I'm gonna call this the ultimate classic game collection. this has some of the best games ever made on it !
[8:20:49] <+korpse413> can't wait to talk about the Nintendo Direct with you guys Sunday, but tonight is Capcom. Grats on getting selected for this!
[8:20:51] <+baysam2> oh god
[8:21:12] <kyokusagani1996> sweet backflip into the slash!
[8:21:33] <+DragonQuarter> I used a million credits when I played the PS1 version of this
[8:21:39] <DiskCart> Id be many quarters deep by now!
[8:22:29] <don_thenintendofreak99> ah. When you guys were younger, what was the first arcade game you played in the arcade? Also I wanted to say the game that came with Capcom Arcade Stadium is 1943 The Battle of Midway. and Capcom decided to add in another game for free which is Ghost n Goblins for Free.
[8:22:37] <+riky_diamonds> is there any shimmering for Try
[8:23:07] <apresenceinwired> the dreaded shimmer
[8:23:20] <kyokusagani1996> the first arcade game I think I ever played was road runner by atari. @don_thenintendofreak99 it was a very vague memory but it was in a dentists office.
[8:23:22] <don_thenintendofreak99> yeah it is free for a limited time
[8:23:23] <+DragonQuarter> Yep GNG is free until 2/25, the release of Ghosts 'n Goblins Resurrection
[8:23:40] <kyokusagani1996> was also possibly ms pac man as well.
[8:23:57] <don_thenintendofreak99> @kyokusagani1996 you grew up in the 80s didn't you?
[8:24:14] <+SF_Punker> I don't remember THE first, but Mappy was one of my earliest
[8:24:17] <don_thenintendofreak99> also wow atari thats a pretty old game system
[8:24:19] <+korpse413> Was this game featured in Nick Arcade?
[8:24:26] <kyokusagani1996> i actually didnt, 90's. @don_thenintendofreak99 but the dentist that i went too when I was really young had a ms pac man.
[8:24:31] <DiskCart> Which arcade would be the one that you'd spend the most time on if you had it in your gamerooms?
[8:24:32] <starbolt89> i think my was mike Tyson punch out
[8:24:36] <+DragonQuarter> crazy aerial combat
[8:24:57] <+DragonQuarter> @korpse413 Nick Arcade had Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts
[8:25:02] <kyokusagani1996> Well.... I have spent over 40 hours on salamander / lifeforce. @DiskCart which is pretty much one of my favorite games of all time.
[8:25:02] <geraldtjy> One of the first games I saw in the arcade was the original Street Fighter. I thought it was a game based on Karate Kid.
[8:25:23] <kyokusagani1996> i've looped that game twice and have gotten to loop 3 stage 3 !
[8:25:23] <@Moobot> The Capcom Arcade Stadium Retro Marathon is running from 10 AM to 10 PM Pacific February 18th and 19th! Schedule: http://bit.ly/3ue6miv
[8:25:44] <don_thenintendofreak99> there is so much to learn about arcade games. I was born in 1999 to be honest. the year Super Smash Bros came out on Nintendo 64
[8:26:08] <DiskCart> @kyokusagani1996 that actually looks awesome!
[8:26:08] <kyokusagani1996> you will learn a lot from this, even things I didn't know !
[8:26:29] <kyokusagani1996> capcom manufactured their own arcade cabinets in japan too and you can actually see all of them in this collection.
[8:27:23] <kyokusagani1996> @DiskCart our family always was one console generation behind so I grew up on games from the past instead. there's so much cool stuff to find here .
[8:27:48] <kyokusagani1996> Side arms says hi , that's one nobody's herad of but is awesome !
[8:28:15] <+DragonQuarter> those mechanical gorillas are freaky

[8:29:42] <+Replicant813> Gotta time those knife jabs a bit better!
[8:29:44] <don_thenintendofreak99> this game looks tough
[8:30:20] <+ff_supergreekfyter> Turbo button???
[8:30:28] <ProtonJon> Always grateful to Backloggery for the idea for Fortune Cookie. It's why your logo's always there.
[8:31:43] <+korpse413> i wonder if battletoads was inspired by this. ProtonJon you ever play W:A anymore? ;)
[8:31:51] <+DragonQuarter> Oh gawd I remember that centipede. So many fascinating designs here
[8:31:57] <+Replicant813> I thought strider and forgotten worlds are in the same universe somehow. Because their music sounds similar :)
[8:31:58] <don_thenintendofreak99> @ProtonJon what was the first Arcade game you played at the arcade?
[8:32:23] <SDShepard> you fall and die and then he shoots your dead body
[8:32:43] <ProtonJon> @don_thenintendofreak99 First one I can remember is Arch Rivals
[8:32:47] <+Mechagojira> yay, Backloggery represent! been watching the streams since it was on justin tv
[8:33:05] <ProtonJon> @korpse413 Yeah I still play W:A from time to time.
[8:33:26] <+Replicant813> This guy can be a pain
[8:33:32] <TheBlacktastic> coolGG
[8:33:35] <+DragonQuarter> Woo, Triumphs
[8:33:39] <don_thenintendofreak99> Wait you died and Defeated the final boss!!!!!
[8:33:58] <JaPanch> wow i just came to snoop and watch the very ending
[8:33:59] <+DragonQuarter> love this music. Junko Tamiya FTW
[8:34:04] <+riky_diamonds> strider, king of the sea
[8:34:10] <+Replicant813> I‚Äôve never seen the arcade ending. Just the Genesis way different
[8:34:37] <SDShepard> lol can your initials just be 3 littles guys in a row
[8:35:30] <SDShepard> monkaS

[8:35:45] <don_thenintendofreak99> I'm Sorry is anyone going to bring up the fact that Coerry Died to the final boss but the final boss died and yet he still won?!?!?!
[8:36:08] <+Replicant813> That happens a lot on the end guy.
[8:36:32] <don_thenintendofreak99> oh i didn't know that tbh LUL
[8:36:49] <SDShepard> you can see the joysticks wiggle in cabinet mode
[8:38:03] <+DragonQuarter> Some games are less forgiving about dying at the same time as the boss!
[8:38:17] <+Replicant813> That is a strider thing for sure
[8:38:45] <SDShepard> Mercs is so rude the boss can be completely dead and you can still die from a projectile they shot
[8:38:52] <don_thenintendofreak99> Ghost n Goblins did that to me I killed the demon that kidnapped the princess but i died and had to do the level LUL
[8:40:09] <+Replicant813> the cut scene timing has always been weird in the arcade game.
[8:41:17] <+DragonQuarter> Strider 2 was '99 so yeah, the look was taken from MvC
[8:42:36] <sainrub> siberian wilderness is my favorite coury
[8:42:57] <+DragonQuarter> Strider 2 is sick. I should pick that game up again on my Vita
