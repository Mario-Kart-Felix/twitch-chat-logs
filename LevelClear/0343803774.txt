[0:04:48] <Inebriateddonut> The Podcast is neat though
[0:04:58] <+meme_aleph> @Dzikka Try searching on the first mission on Phobos
[0:04:59] <Twoiis> So who's going to be on controls for the most part?
[0:05:03] <+anar_bael> Hello salty, nick
[0:05:10] <AncelDeLambert> Man, I hate vagina-head
[0:05:20] <AncelDeLambert> "I'm altering the deal"
[0:05:46] <AncelDeLambert> Game is a smidge too high, but so is Pat, so whatever
[0:05:49] <Dzikka> @meme_aleph ok thanks I'm still on mars but will do whent I get here
[0:05:49] <AncelDeLambert> You guys sound good
[0:05:52] <Inebriateddonut> Sounds good, game might be a tad loud
[0:06:14] <+MellowYellowFellow> Lets go!
[0:06:18] <+anar_bael> Game seems a tad bit loud but otherwise good
[0:06:32] <+anar_bael> I wanna see you guys get red crits
[0:06:34] <AncelDeLambert> not exclusive, but prohibitive
[0:06:35] <Twoiis> 'no problem' eeeeehhh
[0:06:50] <AncelDeLambert> Mag gets too much hate
[0:07:16] <frozenottsel> I like Mag : D
[0:07:31] <AncelDeLambert> Mag is the easiest to find later on, so basically never grab her
[0:07:42] <+anar_bael> mag is better than before but man is excal and volt good
[0:08:16] <+MellowYellowFellow> Destiny 3 looking good
[0:08:37] <faegbeard> YE YE YE

[0:08:49] <+coxon96> yeyeyeye
[0:08:52] <+anar_bael> Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure
[0:08:53] <Twoiis> Lots of options. Might want to adjust sensitivity.
[0:08:54] <AncelDeLambert> Space mom is singing
[0:09:00] <AncelDeLambert> Laaaaaaaa!
[0:09:19] <buster7800> HYPEST OPTION MENU ON TWITCH
[0:09:20] <AncelDeLambert> Kill them all, Jason
[0:09:20] <Mrbaconator> @LevelClear Did pat tell you how he and matt created warframe i can't remember
[0:09:27] <Inebriateddonut> better
[0:09:32] <AncelDeLambert> sound is lovely
[0:09:47] <Mrbaconator> Good
[0:09:49] <+anar_bael> sound is good
[0:09:52] <Mrbaconator> cuz they super did
[0:10:03] <Inebriateddonut> You can switch toggle or hold if you want
[0:10:20] <AncelDeLambert> lol I started with the bo back in the day
[0:10:44] <AncelDeLambert> "a" food
[0:10:52] <AncelDeLambert> the knives SUCK
[0:10:54] <faegbeard> GUN
[0:10:55] <Inebriateddonut> But it's cool ninja shit though
[0:10:59] <SummonerMagno> kunai are okay
[0:11:03] <AncelDeLambert> they're awful without mods
[0:11:13] <Nordguy> kunai are very decent
[0:11:40] <+anar_bael> fire rate up with kunai is great to see
[0:11:42] <+babrukus> he holds like 4 in each hand and reloading is just grabbing more from the pouch lol
[0:12:05] <AncelDeLambert> my eye-meats are too crappy to properly lead the knife shots
[0:12:21] <AncelDeLambert> oh noooooooo
[0:12:30] <Inebriateddonut> BLOCK THAT LASER WITH YOUR SWORD
[0:12:57] <AncelDeLambert> well, you're not blocking it WELL, if that's what you mean
[0:13:01] <+anar_bael> if you can break something it usually has resources for you
[0:13:29] <AncelDeLambert> it's been forever, DO you get to choose a main?
[0:13:56] <+babrukus> braton or paris
[0:13:56] <+SSaryn> It's been too long since I've done to the tutorial at all, it's been like... 2012.
[0:13:57] <Inebriateddonut> You choose between braton and paris I think
[0:14:04] <+legendfather_of_giants> bow or rifle
[0:14:06] <+jt427> isnt it the braton paris and strun
[0:14:08] <AncelDeLambert> oh, is it the bow? Okay, yeah, I think I remember that.
[0:14:13] <faegbeard> primary is a bit later iirc, watched liam a few days ago
[0:14:25] <AncelDeLambert> Oh, how's Liam liking it?
[0:14:25] <FujoshiCadet> time for LC to surpass SBF subs
[0:14:27] <+anar_bael> braton or paris
[0:14:38] <+anar_bael> GUN or bow
[0:14:40] <CertainlySyrix> @AncelDeLambert He said he liked it, and would probably play it again sometime.
[0:14:47] <AncelDeLambert> @CertainlySyrix sweeeet
[0:15:12] <AncelDeLambert> it would be hilarious if these guys chose the kunai and the paris.... because I did that. Woops.
[0:15:34] <CertainlySyrix> I still use wall dash plenty.
[0:15:40] <+SSaryn> Both are really useful on their own honestly.
[0:15:42] <+legendfather_of_giants> SPY
[0:16:05] <badmr7> yo
[0:16:08] <Inebriateddonut> Also controller aiming too
[0:16:10] <CertainlySyrix> You can replace the Paris after a few missions.
[0:16:15] <AncelDeLambert> thankfully, your weapons also allow boss sneak attacks
[0:16:15] <CertainlySyrix> and the kunai
[0:16:20] <+anar_bael> the power of GUN now flows through you
[0:16:42] <+SSaryn> GUN

[0:23:27] <+SSaryn> Random can also give you some colors you don't have access to as well.
[0:23:32] <FujoshiCadet> eva colors!
[0:23:37] <+SSaryn> SOME.
[0:23:55] <shinsolaire96> r a r e e x c a l
[0:24:05] <AncelDeLambert> look at that GI Joe shit, fuck ye
[0:24:59] <+drabberfaun535> ahhhh there is no video quality options
[0:25:18] <+alphonseisbest> thats a nerf rifle
[0:25:20] <AncelDeLambert> look at dem knif pockets
[0:25:23] <+SSaryn> There's definitely a lot of options in Warframe I wish were just copy-pasted to every single PC and Console game.
[0:25:26] <Chichen> NERF DART MAN
[0:25:48] <+SSaryn> N E R F T H I S
[0:26:02] <TheMilhouseExperience> It's NERF or Nuffin'
[0:26:05] <buster7800> it's nerf or nothing!
[0:26:29] <Inebriateddonut> *Energy wave pat it's different
[0:26:31] <+alphonseisbest> NERF with the hard R
[0:26:34] <+SSaryn> And is also one of the best abilities in the game. Exalted Blade is fucking STRONG.
[0:26:40] <captainthunderwolf> Oh man, that link Pat RTed sent me to the mobile site and I had a fucking panic attack.
[0:26:51] <+anar_bael> exalted gun is best gun
[0:26:59] <+babrukus> only better exalted is Mesa's pistols
[0:27:19] <AncelDeLambert> YEYEYEYE big dick Excal energy!
[0:27:22] <buster7800> also exalted cowboy pistols
[0:27:48] <Inebriateddonut> Wait I thought you were supposed to unlock that later?
[0:28:24] <buster7800> PAT WAIT UNTIL THEGAME STARTS THAT TUTORIAL
[0:28:29] <SulfurousAcid> Now ship colors Pat
[0:28:53] <+BestTeaMaker> that was a mistake
[0:29:00] <+SSaryn> Welp. Be prepared for every single person to friend request.
[0:29:12] <xeros720> should've picked a better one like X3 or X4
[0:29:21] <TheInkshow> I cant watch this, quality is too high for my toaster
[0:29:45] <velemi> When Pat was good at games
[0:29:51] <Inebriateddonut> Aren't you still a toxic child pat?
[0:29:51] <+Xravius> You still are toxic, shep
[0:29:52] <Psyramics> *WAS*
[0:29:54] <+Xravius> Pat~
[0:30:08] <+SSaryn> Childs are basically apatBig toxic
[0:30:16] <AncelDeLambert> I remember being that weird kid who played with his stationary and making ninja sounds during class
[0:30:27] <Twoiis> lol
[0:30:29] <xeros720> ahaha, they went to the relay
[0:30:31] <+SSaryn> Oh well
[0:30:32] <xeros720> i didn't even know you could do that
[0:30:35] <+SSaryn> Guess they can go to the relay
[0:30:43] <ScarletVenture> Oh boy here we go
[0:30:50] <AncelDeLambert> whatever, go look at stores
[0:31:06] <xeros720> going swimmingly
[0:31:12] <+BestTeaMaker> time for pat to swing his big dick frame
[0:31:29] <+coxon96> OOOOOH YEAH STRAIGHT OFF THE INTENDED PATH
[0:31:32] <AncelDeLambert> at what point do you become able to choose factions?
[0:31:37] <+alphonseisbest> is he on public?
[0:31:55] <AncelDeLambert> that is very red
[0:32:03] <riantDeliration> i think syndicates are like mr3
[0:32:38] <AncelDeLambert> yeyeye Ember
[0:32:44] <+SSaryn> It's possible because PS4, maybe they won't be able to interact?
[0:32:51] <+alphonseisbest> does ps4 and pc have cross play? or is Lc on pc?
[0:33:04] <Chichen> no crossplay at all
[0:33:06] <GarrisonArmory> There is no console/PC crossplay
[0:33:10] <Chichen> but they are on pc with controllers
[0:33:16] <+SSaryn> Ah ok, well nvm.
[0:33:25] <GodlyLuigi> they on the same region?
[0:33:30] <AncelDeLambert> play on the version with the better hardware, yo
[0:33:33] <Twoiis> Hit R1 and follow the quest line.
[0:33:34] <SulfurousAcid> tell him to hit R1
[0:33:59] <xeros720> wear your damn glasses
[0:34:07] <AncelDeLambert> oh god, it's Paige all over again
[0:34:20] <AncelDeLambert> sipsipSipsipblind sipsipSipsipblind
[0:34:21] <+coxon96> Still not as bad as Paige
[0:34:28] <+SSaryn> Definitely not as bad as Paige.
[0:34:45] <xeros720> tear ass, like you guys do
[0:34:51] <+alphonseisbest> l3 or R3
[0:35:00] <+SimonTheDigger> Skate fast, tear ass
[0:35:08] <+SSaryn> Tear-ass House EH? EH? sbfpPoopking
[0:35:19] <+SSaryn> please watch Terrace House...
[0:35:44] <AncelDeLambert> daaaang
[0:35:59] <Inebriateddonut> Wouldn't it technically more like vanquish with all the butt-sliding?
[0:36:16] <velemi> Or superior space cat
[0:36:17] <AncelDeLambert> also, white lockers are mission specific
[0:36:22] <+coxon96> Bit of advice, always be sprinting
[0:36:29] <buster7800> hey jump while you slide
[0:36:33] <AncelDeLambert> well, not mission, what the hell is the right word
[0:37:40] <+SimonTheDigger> They're specific to Sabotage missions
[0:37:41] <+SSaryn> As long as it's silent, it's a good to do.
[0:37:51] <badmr7> Its fun once you get to big murder
[0:38:00] <SulfurousAcid> Rank Up
[0:38:07] <AncelDeLambert> White lockers give rewards at the end of the mission, that's the right explanation
[0:39:22] <+SSaryn> Most shotguns are FUCKING amazing in this game.
[0:39:26] <Inebriateddonut> He's trying to go for a non-lethal run
[0:39:45] <+babrukus> Imagine having to AIM to hit your enemies - this post made by the PLASMOR gang
[0:39:48] <+kenpachi9211> apatDab PRO TIP apatDab
[0:39:48] <+anar_bael> spin to win melee
[0:39:48] <+SimonTheDigger> Headshots are usually a 2x damage multiplier
[0:39:52] <+legendfather_of_giants> most of the best weapons in the game are shottys too
[0:40:06] <+SSaryn> Specifically called Coptering.
[0:40:20] <+babrukus> gosh I miss coptering
[0:40:36] <+SSaryn> You can still Copter to an extent, but yeah, it's definitely not as strong.
[0:41:11] <SulfurousAcid> rolling around at the speed o sound
[0:41:31] <ScarletVenture> *distant panicked screams*
[0:41:40] <+SSaryn> This is where you spend HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS! Hope you like it.
[0:41:56] <+babrukus> chroma looking good
[0:41:57] <buster7800> THE MOST BAFFLLING UI DECISION EVER
[0:42:11] <faegbeard> "the cash store but also not the cash store oops"
[0:42:26] <buster7800> WHY WOULD YOU SLAP A NEWBIE WITH ALL YOUR FREEMIUN BS RIGHT AT THE TUTORIAL
[0:42:30] <+BestTeaMaker> so, pat is half right about the market
[0:42:35] <+BestTeaMaker> the market is also actually your lvl up screen
[0:43:09] <Inebriateddonut> Technically supposed to be breaking Darvo out I believe
[0:43:53] <Inebriateddonut> Rolling mitigates damage by 80% as well
[0:44:37] <faegbeard> That's crazy talk, rolling also makes you take less damage. Good for rolling through flame eximii
[0:44:55] <Inebriateddonut> Oh yeah it also does ignore knockdowns too
[0:45:24] <AncelDeLambert> huh, really?
[0:45:30] <xeros720> you can't reload while you roll
[0:45:35] <xeros720> but you can reload while bullet jumping
[0:45:35] <+legendfather_of_giants> Everything is op here
[0:45:37] <AncelDeLambert> earth is an irradiated pit, it's great
[0:45:49] <+other_badger> more like hundreds of thousands of years tbh
[0:46:10] <velemi> LUL
[0:46:10] <Inebriateddonut> I think it's slightly A LOT more than a hundred years
[0:46:11] <GarrisonArmory> In the ninja flipping future there will be only tenno
[0:46:18] <+anar_bael> PRAISE BE TO THE GOD EMPEROR OF MAN
[0:46:21] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, it's pretty clear that humanity has been trapped in our solar system for a VERY long time
[0:46:55] <SulfurousAcid> Pupper Snuffers
[0:47:02] <+anar_bael> clones of clones of clones which fuck up the DNA used for said clones
[0:47:09] <+BestTeaMaker> soon you too will be able to grow your own dog from eggs
[0:47:15] <+BestTeaMaker> and he will be the bestest boi
[0:47:25] <Inebriateddonut> Fun Fact: Grineer armor is inflatable
[0:47:35] <AncelDeLambert> pretty Terran, yeah
[0:47:52] <AncelDeLambert> especially since the other two are almost literally Zerg and Protoss
[0:47:58] <+other_badger> inflation Kreygasm
[0:48:09] <+anar_bael> can't wait for them to meet the money cult
[0:48:34] <AncelDeLambert> Pat laying out what's IMPORTANT in this damn game
[0:48:44] <AncelDeLambert> come on, devs, put in the REAL tutorials we need!
[0:48:49] <SulfurousAcid> The outside too
[0:48:50] <+BestTeaMaker> good job
[0:48:53] <xeros720> it keeps happening
[0:48:53] <+BestTeaMaker> now you're warframing for reals
[0:48:57] <SulfurousAcid> Pat teach them the outside
[0:49:00] <SulfurousAcid> yes
[0:49:01] <AncelDeLambert> that actually looks really good
[0:49:06] <+Boscuito> now you're thinking with warframes
[0:49:07] <ItsAbout9000> 90s lazer tag ring
[0:49:12] <ScarletVenture> It's Nerf or Nothing
[0:49:41] <GarrisonArmory> You could learn the game, or you can dress up your space dolls space house
[0:49:51] <+BestTeaMaker> that is the game
[0:50:07] <GarrisonArmory> Fashion Frame
[0:50:12] <Inebriateddonut> Wait until you get to noggles and decorations
[0:50:19] <SulfurousAcid> I got all green and purple myself
[0:50:28] <velemi> Darvo is a good boy
[0:50:39] <+Boscuito> never has a good eal though
[0:50:43] <+SSaryn> YEYEYEYEYE
[0:50:44] <AncelDeLambert> at least the escort missions in this game aren't that bad
[0:50:52] <+SSaryn> NOGGLES AND FLOOFS ARE THE TRUE END GAME
[0:51:03] <faegbeard> legend of the noggle kings
[0:51:04] <+Xravius> Btw, the random colours isnt random, when you have base colour schemes, they are all set. I had a friend in the beta who got the same random colour on frost as me.
[0:51:07] <ScarletVenture> Ludoplex.
[0:51:15] <Twoiis> I like grineer gun names.
[0:51:16] <+BestTeaMaker> FLOOFS
[0:51:20] <GarrisonArmory> Legally destinct!
[0:51:27] <AncelDeLambert> whaaaaaaaat?! Fucking NEED!
[0:51:53] <+SSaryn> Looked like a bad version of the Mercury tileset for pretty much 2 years.
[0:51:59] <+Boscuito> they USUALLY replace them
[0:52:07] <+Boscuito> they still haev the corpus ship from the closed beta
[0:52:19] <AncelDeLambert> Ludicrous Speed, GO!
[0:52:25] <ScarletVenture> It doesn't turn all particles plaid?
[0:52:34] <GarrisonArmory> Fortuna got us some newer corpus models at the very least
[0:52:57] <Nordguy> if you want to have a look at how it looked earlier, TotalBiscuit did a WTF is... video on it
[0:53:04] <frozenottsel> ew
[0:53:04] <buster7800> we gonna have a new gas city tileset SOONTM
[0:53:06] <+SSaryn> Sweating in bed specifically feels like one of the worst feelings in your life.
[0:53:42] <+Boscuito> god look at what the weapon upgrades during the closed beta
[0:53:51] <Inebriateddonut> Skillup is Australian Pat?
[0:54:01] <+Boscuito> a literal skilltree that kept the stats locked behind potatoes
[0:54:05] <+SSaryn> Waow
[0:54:09] <Inebriateddonut> No it's Jail Britain
[0:54:11] <ScarletVenture> Australia is Spider Britain
[0:54:22] <+alphonseisbest> yes, indeed
[0:54:26] <+Halowood> Meet me at the maccas car park at woy woy and say that
[0:55:02] <MartiusGW> yeah, game was bit wierd in beta
[0:55:17] <Agami23> I feel like a big thing about all this is that destiny came out years after warframe and is weirdly similar. almost ripoff levels
[0:55:22] <+President_Miyazaki> Pat I just got here, you've said "Right?" like 20 times already.
[0:55:31] <+Boscuito> remember when excaliburs...3 skill was just a
[0:55:34] <+Boscuito> Big Jump
[0:55:47] <+SSaryn> Nice. We got one of those bugs just now.
[0:55:47] <Inebriateddonut> Well sometimes you still fall through the world
[0:55:51] <+President_Miyazaki> Is this the new "You see what I mean?" and "Perfect."
[0:55:58] <+SSaryn> Darvo just not having a weapon despite holding one.
[0:56:04] <+Boscuito> drop your sword
[0:56:08] <GarrisonArmory> My favorite is when I get knocked out of Hysteria in Valk, but I'm not actually out of it. So I can't attack and I can be hit. Its great.
[0:56:20] <Inebriateddonut> Didn
[0:56:30] <Inebriateddonut> didn't the sequal remove stuff?
[0:56:58] <GarrisonArmory> Destiny 2 failed to add some improvements they had at the end of Destiny 1 I heard.
[0:56:59] <+BestTeaMaker> yeah
[0:57:02] <xeros720> ahaha
[0:57:07] <xeros720> i just beat second dream last night!
[0:57:10] <+BestTeaMaker> destiny 2 was destiny 1 lite
[0:57:16] <+KingofTwitchTV> how long have they been streaming?
[0:57:25] <velemi> Shields gone
[0:58:05] <+BestTeaMaker> the nice things about hostages is that they auto teleport, so don't worry too much about leaving them behind
[0:58:20] <+BestTeaMaker> sometimes they get caught out, but most of the time they're fine
[0:58:28] <GarrisonArmory> Explain broken mods Pat
[0:58:39] <Twoiis> Tutorial mods.
[0:58:39] <+BestTeaMaker> TIME TO EXPLAIN THE MODDING SYSTEM, PAT
[0:58:41] <ScarletVenture> Somewhat bad, somewhat good.
[0:58:46] <+SuichiTanaka> They actually give new players flawed versions of the 'required' mods now
[0:58:47] <+BestTeaMaker> THE TRUE GET BIG SYSTEM
[0:58:55] <Inebriateddonut> You're gonna wanna get better ones soon
[0:58:58] <+babrukus> you always get broken ones from this, just so starter people can use 'em
[0:59:00] <+anar_bael> you wanna tell them what the apparent optimal movement actions are to get through missions the fastest
[0:59:02] <+gutlesscoward> they're basically just tutorial mods
[0:59:03] <+SuichiTanaka> It's a lot better than getting nothing at all
[0:59:09] <fairore> lmao
[0:59:09] <velemi> The broken mods are so new players can have some of the "core" mods
[0:59:11] <MartiusGW> thats not ghost
[0:59:42] <+SSaryn> O H N O
[1:00:09] <+GuelermeDias> Modding isn't that hard.
[1:00:11] <Inebriateddonut> They're basically your alphabet blocks of mods
[1:00:12] <+BestTeaMaker> Pat, this might be a good time to teach them how leveling in this game works
[1:00:14] <+babrukus> you might as well upgrade them, they're pretty cheap
[1:00:16] <+GuelermeDias> You put the stuff that does Big Damage in.
[1:00:18] <+BestTeaMaker> and how the market functions in leveling
[1:00:19] <+Kaffeebohnson> Is this the Warframe University?
[1:00:27] <+Kaffeebohnson> Modding 101
[1:00:30] <velemi> I mean, sometimes the broken mods are good for min-maxing a build when you need to sqeeze just a tiny bit more in
[1:01:18] <+Boscuito> yeah but
[1:01:27] <MartiusGW> for new player sure, later they are usually useless beyond maybe leveling new weapon/frame
[1:01:28] <buster7800> square peg in the square hole
[1:01:36] <+Boscuito> you can always fit a more versatile/dense mod
[1:01:38] <Inebriateddonut> Shields are alright early on too but later health is better
[1:01:51] <+Boscuito> or armor
[1:02:04] <+SuichiTanaka> It's actually great that they give new players some core mods now, despite being flawed. The main issue is that you're so starved for Endo at early level that it makes them useless
[1:02:30] <+GuelermeDias> patrick there's a bear in tekken grand finals just thought you should know
[1:02:34] <AncelDeLambert> up to some differences in weapon type
[1:02:50] <+legendfather_of_giants> when primes
[1:02:53] <AncelDeLambert> Shotguns have some differences from rifles
[1:03:08] <+legendfather_of_giants> primed goes up to 165
[1:03:08] <+SSaryn> Thank god Primed Serration isn't a thing.
[1:03:39] <+SSaryn> There always is, seeing Panda or Kuma is Grand Finals is always a nice feeling.
[1:03:55] <ScarletVenture> pressure point
[1:03:57] <Inebriateddonut> Hornet strike is all secondaries
[1:03:59] <+BestTeaMaker> is it the same panda that went far in evo?
[1:04:08] <+GuelermeDias> Yeah, it's Rangchu
[1:04:11] <+babrukus> basically always use the flat damage mods
[1:04:14] <ScarletVenture> Bread & Butters
[1:04:14] <+BestTeaMaker> fuck yeah, rangchu
[1:04:24] <+alphonseisbest> there many a bear in Tekan
[1:04:51] <+BestTeaMaker> the is the MOST important part of your ship
[1:04:55] <+SSaryn> OH FUCK I DIDN'T SEE, ARMOR KING FOR TEKKEN 7
[1:05:06] <riantDeliration> time to get the iphone timer app
[1:05:21] <Inebriateddonut> The most important part is the MARKET so you can buy SPACE DOLL HATS
[1:05:26] <+SSaryn> Also oh boi, one of the nicest looking tile set out of the basic ones.
[1:05:38] <+GuelermeDias> Negan also murdered Paul.
[1:05:41] <+GuelermeDias> He's dead forever now.
[1:05:47] <velemi> I mean, navigation is pretty important
[1:05:51] <+BestTeaMaker> goddamit still no majima?
[1:05:54] <fairore> i got the hey kiddo out no where
[1:06:04] <ScarletVenture> Hallways is the same
[1:06:29] <+eshafferart> tell them about Vay Hek
[1:06:31] <+jt427> sealab tile set is fantastic too
[1:06:32] <Inebriateddonut> He has a very unfortunate name
[1:06:38] <+SSaryn> Oh boi, Vay Hek is a fucking trip.
[1:06:39] <AncelDeLambert> the higher up the Grineer ranks you climb, the more metal they put in you
[1:06:40] <buster7800> L O O K A T T H E M
[1:06:41] <velemi> They come to this place
[1:06:41] <sosuke5> Pewdiepie vs T-series is a weird timeline to be in
[1:06:55] <faegbeard> M A G G O T S
[1:06:56] <+alphonseisbest> they come to this place
[1:07:01] <+RaikenTB> Dat's a nice orange and blue warframe.
[1:07:03] <+SSaryn> He is never in a state of not screaming.
[1:07:09] <buster7800> WHEN THEY KNOW THAY ARE NOT PURE
[1:07:09] <Rellim80> @bestteamaker We're never getting Majima
[1:07:11] <velemi> when they know they are not pure
[1:07:11] <+HelloImTom08> he's a potato with a robot body
[1:07:16] <Inebriateddonut> I think there might be one line that he doesn't shout
[1:07:18] <+BestTeaMaker> FeelsBadMan
[1:07:18] <+babrukus> M A G G OT S! W OR MS!
[1:07:26] <+jt427> check out alexa vay hek on youtube. its beautiful
[1:07:37] <ScarletVenture> Vay Hek's glorious bod is explained in a side-comic.
[1:07:48] <buster7800> WHY ARE THESE M A G G O T S STILL BREATHING MY AIR!!!
[1:07:48] <ScarletVenture> He got ate by zombos.
[1:08:01] <Inebriateddonut> Pretty much every boss was 'just a dude" before all the reworks
[1:08:05] <riantDeliration> if theres damage from falling in a hole ive literally never noticed it
[1:08:07] <+BestTeaMaker> i don't think you even take damage, i think you just lose w/e buffs you had on you
[1:08:18] <GarrisonArmory> What BestTea said
[1:08:20] <ScarletVenture> Fall damage is a spoiler
[1:08:39] <+BestTeaMaker> it's basically DE's failsafe for when players are jumping around too much into pits
[1:08:47] <jcflyguy> I kind of miss Coptering
[1:09:04] <+SuichiTanaka> I like Slide > Jump > Bullet Glide > Double Jump > Bullet Glide
[1:09:20] <ScarletVenture> I mean, Volt
[1:10:07] <+SSaryn> Oh yeah that happened a lot when people didn't know about Coptering.
[1:10:15] <+BestTeaMaker> so, what's interesting about this game is that content is constant for all levels of players
[1:10:23] <+anar_bael> melee while sliding is a fighting style in this game
[1:11:19] <+babrukus> RED crit
[1:11:21] <+babrukus> *
[1:11:25] <+HelloImTom08> meme strike
[1:11:31] <+BestTeaMaker> oh that one, the big money mod
[1:11:35] <velemi> Didn't maiming strike get nerfed?
[1:11:35] <+BestTeaMaker> LUL
[1:11:44] <+SSaryn> Wouldn't be surprised if it's about 6000-9000 Platnium
[1:11:44] <+babrukus> not till melee 3.0
[1:11:49] <riantDeliration> yeah thats pretty bad
[1:11:55] <+QuadraticGravity> Are you talking about Maiming Strike?
[1:11:57] <+President_Miyazaki> Maiming Strike still drops though.
[1:11:59] <+SuichiTanaka> Maiming strike is 75% bonus chance to crit on slide attack, IIRC
[1:11:59] <+anar_bael> it still drops, it's just a specific enemy that is an event boss
[1:12:02] <+Boscuito> looks like its about 230 plat nowadays
[1:12:02] <ScarletVenture> Maiming Strike still drops when the Edgeboys come around.
[1:12:03] <+gutlesscoward> they still run the event that drops that, like once a year
[1:12:04] <Inebriateddonut> Wouldn't it still drop once the acolytes come around?
[1:12:20] <GarrisonArmory> Think so
[1:12:21] <+BestTeaMaker> welcome to the warframe economy
[1:12:30] <+SSaryn> OH BOI PAT, FLAPPY ZEPHYR, TELL 'EM.
[1:12:31] <+babrukus> yeah warframe.market says 230 plat
[1:12:36] <velemi> Has Pat told them about Rivens yet?
[1:12:39] <+kingoffight1153> can i join ya guys
[1:12:40] <+BestTeaMaker> FLAPPY ZEPHYR BEST MINIGAME
[1:12:42] <Inebriateddonut> HEY YOU WANNA PLAY FLAPPY FRAME GUYS?
[1:12:45] <TheMilhouseExperience> Thank god PT was saved though.
[1:12:48] <+President_Miyazaki> Maiming Strike still drops from Acolytes Pat.
[1:12:50] <+Boscuito> dont forget the weapon variants for crits on headshot when aiming
[1:12:50] <+anar_bael> rivens are even more broken
[1:12:53] <+Boscuito> argon scope etc
[1:13:01] <+kingoffight1153> can i join ya?
[1:13:16] <+jt427> oh damn, i got like 4 of those, lol

[1:13:58] <Inebriateddonut> US Deez nuts?
[1:14:11] <+SSaryn> Man, that Bitcoin shit goes down a couple hundred every week.
[1:14:12] <+iambeastx> maiming strike is a rare drop from xmas event mobs
[1:14:38] <TheMilhouseExperience> Doesn't bitcoin crash every winter?
[1:14:51] <+BestTeaMaker> GOTTA GO BIG FAST
[1:14:56] <GarrisonArmory> So Big and Fast
[1:14:57] <Kghaleon> Been playing this nonstop since Switch release and it finally just got hard for me, damn those Bursa enemies.
[1:15:11] <+SSaryn> Yeah this tileset was here in the Closed Beta.
[1:15:23] <+babrukus> shoot dah fan
[1:15:29] <xeros720> yeah, the vent fan
[1:15:40] <+SSaryn> Recently anyone in the Closed Beta got their Accolade for it as well.
[1:15:42] <+babrukus> ze glass
[1:15:43] <riantDeliration> its always funny to me how you can trivialize every Void obstacle course with bullet jumps
[1:15:45] <+Xravius> Excalibur prime bby
[1:15:55] <AncelDeLambert> bring me my detonators
[1:16:03] <+Xravius> yeye

[1:16:09] <+SSaryn> Ehh, Umbra exists so that's fine.
[1:16:13] <Inebriateddonut> Founder bois!
[1:16:15] <+SuichiTanaka> I was in Closed Beta, but didn't buy into Excal. I did get a Lato Vandal though
[1:16:20] <+Boscuito> yeah i got mine. didnt know why because some russians tried to steal my account and locked it down for a week
[1:16:20] <+kingoffight1153> dont have to show off
[1:16:25] <+kingoffight1153> i dont
[1:16:25] <+anar_bael> Primes are the fancy boy version
[1:16:25] <+President_Miyazaki> Umbra is also better than Excalibur Prime lol
[1:16:34] <+BestTeaMaker> excalibur prime is no longer available
[1:16:37] <+babrukus> yeah excal prime is just to show off that your an OG anymore, umbra exists
[1:16:40] <+kingoffight1153> trinity is beter than ex
[1:16:41] <+babrukus> you're
[1:16:47] <+legendfather_of_giants> also pretty and gold
[1:16:49] <+BestTeaMaker> so DE had to make exaclibur umbra as an apology
[1:16:54] <+Boscuito> the MOST expensive backer package i think
[1:16:56] <+SSaryn> For almost 7 years now.
[1:17:06] <+Xravius> I bought it, and stopped playing for years lol
[1:17:07] <+HelloImTom08> or they got a fancy influencer hookup

[1:21:07] <+BestTeaMaker> FOR PROFIT
[1:21:09] <+LogothX> A remake of max payne would be a slow, plodding cover based shooter. Pass.
[1:21:15] <SulfurousAcid> Pat probably loves their helmets
[1:21:16] <+OceanGovernor> Protoss analog? you mean money worshiping robotistic GROFTI
[1:21:19] <+gutlesscoward> capitalism is basically their religion
[1:21:21] <+SuichiTanaka> They're just cooler Ferengi

[1:22:11] <+legendfather_of_giants> @levelclear if pat invites you guys to the clan hall, we have an arcade cab.
[1:22:15] <+kingoffight1153> i wish i could play with them
[1:22:27] <+SuichiTanaka> Since you're space ninjas, you don't make any sound with your movement, only gunfire
[1:22:28] <+BestTeaMaker> stealth simultaneously works and doesn't work
[1:22:55] <+Boscuito> that said
[1:22:57] <+Boscuito> DONT SPOIL
[1:22:59] <+RaikenTB> Like that time with the spaghetti getting punched.
[1:23:02] <+BestTeaMaker> THERE'S ONE SPOILER
[1:23:06] <SulfurousAcid> the vent
[1:23:07] <+OceanGovernor> Well there is one BIG spoiler
[1:23:12] <velemi> THERE IS ONE BIG SPOIL
[1:23:15] <+OceanGovernor> but Pat does know of it
[1:23:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat's super good about not doing da BIG SPOIL
[1:23:19] <+anar_bael> chek chek

[1:24:01] <+gutlesscoward> rhythm and squares, the two fundamentals of hacking
[1:24:01] <+jt427> if you join a random game with higher level people youll probably be spoiled and confused
[1:24:09] <Zebylth> thats a hexagon pat
[1:24:12] <ScarletVenture> Six sides, just like a cube

[1:25:37] <+BestTeaMaker> Octavia is the best warframe
[1:25:38] <+SuichiTanaka> Some assholes will just let it all hang out in front of newbs on public places though
[1:25:40] <crimsonharvest> it has a built in midi editor
[1:25:41] <+LogothX> But Plague's a great ass.
[1:25:53] <+SuichiTanaka> but generally the community is super good with the spoilers

[1:30:33] <faegbeard> make him HUMBLE
[1:30:34] <+babrukus> Hogan had freedom powder too
[1:30:45] <crimsonharvest> headbutting the flag is adequately metal
[1:30:51] <+KaneNightshade> Pat likes the King of the Hill frame because he is Cotton Hill
[1:30:54] <+RaikenTB> I dunno there was that one tape that got leaked...
[1:30:59] <Inebriateddonut> THAT"S FUNNY
[1:31:00] <+GuelermeDias> My favorite frame is Musicframe.
[1:31:01] <+SSaryn> Idk, Brooke's Thighs IS A MEME TO BEHOLD WHEN THAT CAME OUT
[1:31:09] <+BestTeaMaker> music frame is cool

[1:31:58] <+Boscuito> but ehy're busted at like
[1:31:59] <+Boscuito> 1 thing
[1:32:07] <SulfurousAcid> Say Poor Pat
[1:32:08] <+SuichiTanaka> Getting all the pieces of Octavia is annoying as hell, but the reward is breaking every encounter in the rest of the game.
[1:32:10] <+Boscuito> and theres 400 things to do
[1:32:19] <+KaneNightshade> Paige can do a perfect Canadian accent

[1:37:01] <+RaikenTB> sipsipElmo "You have to sleep sometime, Pat"

[1:37:50] <+BestTeaMaker> oh, that
[1:37:50] <+goose_attack_almanac> apatDab apatDab apatDab apatDab
[1:37:56] <+OceanGovernor> I think that was probably just a newbie as well
[1:38:13] <+BestTeaMaker> tutorial squads only happen with new people too
[1:38:21] <+OceanGovernor> rooThink can vets even get into these missions?
[1:38:34] <+BestTeaMaker> no
[1:38:52] <AncelDeLambert> Shitnewbs
[1:38:54] <+OceanGovernor> You must wait to show off Pat
[1:39:03] <+BestTeaMaker> Pat has a blue inaros that he wants to show off
[1:39:05] <+BestTeaMaker> Kappa
[1:39:05] <SulfurousAcid> I had to do Vor solo
[1:39:06] <AncelDeLambert> Pat's gloriousness will have to wait
[1:39:13] <Inebriateddonut> A blue inaros that he thinks is purple
[1:39:14] <AncelDeLambert> He's quite mad, you know
[1:39:17] <+KaneNightshade> he wants to show you his Space Barbies
[1:39:25] <+BestTeaMaker> you also have a nice blue cat too
[1:39:26] <+goose_attack_almanac> Royal Blue Space Cat
[1:39:26] <+FadingEmber> Its just going to be rhino
[1:39:30] <AncelDeLambert> Your blue Inaros is so pretty, Pat
[1:39:33] <Dzikka> it's blue Pat
[1:39:44] <+RaikenTB> @AncelDeLambert But what if it was purple?
[1:39:55] <+KaneNightshade> oh god no...don't start this
[1:39:56] <+OceanGovernor> There are different tilesets the levels generate from
[1:39:58] <l0okaway> Yeah pat would just walk through people like a pillar man
[1:40:05] <AncelDeLambert> hehehehehee
[1:40:23] <+goose_attack_almanac> (it is now purple, bu it's more fun to make you question yourself)
[1:40:37] <Inebriateddonut> Weapons give you mastery
[1:41:23] <+BestTeaMaker> Hek is at MR4, pat
[1:41:24] <+Boscuito> lets be honest
[1:41:25] <+babrukus> hek at 4 feels like a god send
[1:41:28] <+OceanGovernor> Just forma that Mk-1 Braton 10 times it will be great
[1:41:35] <+FadingEmber> oh man I just got glitched above the elevators on Relay LuL
[1:41:35] <+Boscuito> once you get the hek you dont need anything else for 10 more mr
[1:41:36] <+BestTeaMaker> nooooooooo
[1:41:36] <+babrukus> then plasmor at 10 and you need no other
[1:41:42] <+RaikenTB> sipsipHellmo
[1:41:46] <+BestTeaMaker> don't even joke about forma-ing an mk1
[1:41:55] <crimsonharvest> how do you do the overhead stomp attack in melee
[1:42:06] <+OceanGovernor> rooH it is the best meme to forma mk-1s
[1:42:11] <Inebriateddonut> Aim downwards and melee in the air
[1:42:19] <+goose_attack_almanac> @crimsonharvest aim the camera downwards and melee midair
[1:42:20] <+KaneNightshade> he's a big good boy
[1:42:28] <faegbeard> i have an 8formed MK1 and it's good enough for sorties
[1:42:35] <ScarletVenture> Slots
[1:42:37] <+BestTeaMaker> OBVIOUSLY YOU USE IT TO BUY THE BIGGEST HAT
[1:43:03] <+SuichiTanaka> Movement and melee are directionally contextual. So looking down while you melee in the air, results in a ground pound
[1:43:13] <+OceanGovernor> Nope no one joined
[1:43:17] <l0okaway> See! Just resting in your account!
[1:43:17] <+SuichiTanaka> and looking up while bullet jumping results in a massive vertical leap
[1:43:24] <SulfurousAcid> use abilities
[1:43:28] <+KaneNightshade> use your abilities
[1:43:39] <crimsonharvest> powers woo
[1:43:54] <Kghaleon> Remember when Spy kept playing Pillars after Pat showed him the game? Oh. Well you remember how Clemps kept playing DBFZ after he taught him how to play? Oh wait.
[1:44:14] <+OceanGovernor> Warframe is better than those
[1:44:25] <+BestTeaMaker> it wasn't pillars, it was monhun
[1:44:26] <faegbeard> trek rackerd
[1:44:32] <+BestTeaMaker> and spy did keep playing it
[1:44:42] <+goose_attack_almanac> Spy played Monhun for a long as heck time
[1:44:54] <l0okaway> It was pillars aswell
[1:44:57] <+QuadraticGravity> BUT PAT THE WINTER FEST IS NOW
[1:45:02] <Inebriateddonut> Eidolons are the monster hunter now
[1:45:04] <+eshafferart> I been playin this game for 5 years and I'm MR 17, my friend I intro'd to the game earlier this year just hit MR 18

[1:45:36] <+gutlesscoward> never EVER
[1:45:38] <+KaneNightshade> never...ever ever

[1:45:53] <+legendfather_of_giants> THE JANUS KEY
[1:45:56] <l0okaway> Sweet little lies
[1:46:04] <+babrukus> THE POWER OF HIS ANUS KEY

[1:46:22] <+eshafferart> Hey Pat, what do you want the next open world section to be?
[1:46:25] <Kghaleon> I mostly use it for gliding/hovering over long distances.
[1:46:26] <crimsonharvest> you used to have to find specific wall jump spots to go up a vertical surface
[1:46:27] <+BestTeaMaker> and what the general gameplay loop is
[1:46:38] <AncelDeLambert> hooray, now build some REAL weapons
[1:46:47] <+jt427> there are different tutorials in the codex you can try
[1:46:51] <Kghaleon> He can get that free sword.
[1:46:52] <+Boscuito> you can tell which tilesets are from the closed beta because all the rooms are at 90 degrees from each other
[1:46:53] <Inebriateddonut> Great tutorial done, now do shit
[1:46:53] <+Boscuito> kinda funny
[1:46:56] <+OceanGovernor> Now let Pat on your ship to flex

[1:55:05] <+OceanGovernor> Link your account and then they pop up in your inventory
[1:55:12] <+babrukus> the little crown thing on the top of twitch usually has a button for it?
[1:55:28] <+OceanGovernor> You get a message in inbox when they appear
[1:55:58] <+gutlesscoward> hooray, the rep system
[1:56:08] <+Sinosaur> Is Frost Prime or Trinity Prime better? I've never got too far into the game, but I have both.
[1:56:21] <+Xravius> Trinity prime is really strong
[1:56:30] <+Boscuito> depends on what you use them for
[1:56:35] <+Boscuito> frost prime is ace on defense missions
[1:56:41] <+OceanGovernor> They do different things Sinosaur, Trinity is a very strong support and healer, Frost is an aoe denial/busrt frame
[1:56:42] <+gutlesscoward> they're both good at different things
[1:56:43] <Inebriateddonut> That's just a message he added
[1:57:02] <+legendfather_of_giants> m+kb for this

[2:04:43] <+Duck_dive_juke> MR2 i believe for dojo
[2:04:52] <dsauce999> @LevelClear Ask him how blue his ship and frame is
[2:05:04] <+Duck_dive_juke> NM
[2:05:04] <l0okaway> Why is everything so difficult?
[2:05:21] <SulfurousAcid> pat what frame you using?
[2:05:31] <+BestTeaMaker> THE LAG
[2:05:33] <+MagickBurritoh> EXCELLENT
[2:05:35] <faegbeard> big lags

[2:06:37] <+QuadraticGravity> That's a dojo issue
[2:06:38] <+OceanGovernor> Yes that is normal dojo stuff
[2:06:38] <Inebriateddonut> That's just how it is in dojo and relays
[2:06:40] <+SuichiTanaka> The direction your camera is looking in, determines the arc of your jump
[2:06:51] <AncelDeLambert> jump WHILE sliding
[2:07:01] <Inebriateddonut> It's to improve performance I think
[2:07:03] <faegbeard> you're letting go of crouch too soon and not doing a bullet jump
[2:07:28] <fruit_pie_the_magician> YOU HAVE TO JUMP DURING THE SLIDE, NOT AFTER
[2:07:30] <+alphonseisbest> there ya go! he a learning
[2:07:35] <+Kghaleon> Does he know what a bullet jump is?
[2:07:45] <+OceanGovernor> Have they done the advanced movement tutorial?
[2:07:59] <+BestTeaMaker> hint about bullet jumping @LevelClear ,you will always move in the direction of your cursor, so aim your cursor higher to get more air
[2:08:01] <xeros720> they have so much bullshit sitting around

[2:14:03] <ScarletVenture> Pat was SO EXCITED
[2:14:20] <dsauce999> PAT...NO!
[2:14:30] <+President_Miyazaki> I think the reason Pat isn't great at teaching people games is because he keeps trying to go to higher concept/end game stuff way to early.
[2:14:48] <LouieRouie> return to orbiter was right there

[2:31:13] <Inebriateddonut> You made the number go UP
[2:31:22] <+SuichiTanaka> Warframe is one of those games where NOTHING makes sense in the beginning. Total sensory overload
[2:31:30] <+QueequegTheater> Redirection

[2:33:39] <Inebriateddonut> PAT talk about tatoes
[2:33:43] <+alphonseisbest> DICK FRAME
[2:33:45] <+Halowood> They will randomly get dramatically more difficult
[2:33:50] <ScreenVoice> get to war within
[2:33:55] <+alphonseisbest> Dick frame has fallen
[2:33:58] <Slim_Lipid> There we go. That's how you sword boi through junctions
[2:34:12] <AncelDeLambert> they will randomly get dramatically more difficult due to you having a bad frame to face them with
[2:34:14] <+gutlesscoward> e l e m e n t s
[2:34:15] <+alphonseisbest> woops
[2:34:40] <shinsolaire96> the 4 elements of hip hop
[2:34:40] <AncelDeLambert> I think I tried to face the Ash one with my Ember, if I remember correctly, and he killed me again and again
[2:34:47] <dsauce999> Man remember the four elements of Avatar? Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Poison?
[2:34:48] <ScarletVenture> Sixsecondary

[2:35:40] <+babrukus> freezy breezy beam boi
[2:35:42] <ScreenVoice> everything changed when the radiation nation attacked
[2:35:47] <Slim_Lipid> Combo elements remind me of RuneScape tbh
[2:35:53] <AncelDeLambert> he's not photo-boi, whom is my son, but he works
[2:36:01] <shinsolaire96> yes star trek is big pat
[2:36:05] <+QuadraticGravity> Starter Plat
[2:36:06] <+gutlesscoward> ah, time-gating
[2:36:08] <dsauce999> Star Trek?

[2:36:16] <+babrukus> fren
[2:36:20] <shinsolaire96> he said trek
[2:36:29] <+alphonseisbest> Darmok at jalad
[2:36:33] <shinsolaire96> cuz pat
[2:36:41] <AncelDeLambert> the time gating that legitimately keeps your from burning yourself out on this game
[2:36:46] <+gutlesscoward> now go to four tuna
[2:36:49] <shinsolaire96> hahahaha
[2:36:53] <shinsolaire96> that dont work
[2:37:05] <Inebriateddonut> Well you still get burned out anyways
[2:37:12] <+QuadraticGravity> Yeah but it happens slower
[2:37:15] <AncelDeLambert> yeah, but it takes ten times as long
[2:37:21] <+BestTeaMaker> YEYEYEYE
[2:37:22] <ScarletVenture> HERE COME THE CONFUSION
[2:37:24] <shinsolaire96> it is a nice *its time to stop* thing though yeah
[2:37:31] <+alphonseisbest> now the grind begins
[2:37:36] <AncelDeLambert> Like, I have 800 hours in this game, it was the dukat grind that finally killed me
[2:37:36] <+JusTTheGuyYouNeed> oh no
[2:37:41] <shinsolaire96> we all grind together
[2:37:47] <+velemi> Now hope they don't see a spoiler
[2:37:48] <Inebriateddonut> yeah big confusion
[2:37:49] <+eshafferart> Pat, tell them about the tower meat
[2:37:53] <+gutlesscoward> LETS GO CUNFOOSION
[2:38:02] <SummonerMagno> remember to look left for meat tower
[2:38:15] <Inebriateddonut> CUTSCENE CONFUSION
[2:38:16] <+SuichiTanaka> Mmmm, the toweryiest!
[2:38:17] <mayorrev> THE MEAT SQUARE
[2:38:22] <AncelDeLambert> Man, seeing this scene for the first time after not playing for two years was NUTS
[2:38:33] <mayorrev> MEAT SQUARE
[2:38:34] <AncelDeLambert> TOWER WHALE
[2:38:43] <SulfurousAcid> BIG MEAT
[2:38:55] <+Boscuito> wheres the beef?
[2:39:03] <+Kghaleon> I was sad when Liam missed the meat tower.
[2:39:08] <mayorrev> the kids are playing warframne
[2:39:09] <+eshafferart> Unrealistic- what kid would willingly die in a pretend fight
[2:39:16] <+eshafferart> They'd go 'no you didn't hit me'
[2:39:16] <ScreenVoice> ikr
[2:39:19] <AncelDeLambert> seriously
[2:39:32] <+SuichiTanaka> They'd be willing to if they got to be the hero immediately after
[2:39:36] <Inebriateddonut> "No electricity doesn't do as much damage on grineer so I'm still alive"
[2:39:42] <+SuichiTanaka> and then the fighting starts
[2:39:48] <+eshafferart> look at the bridge
[2:39:49] <+gutlesscoward> Swahz do-la
[2:39:50] <+UberWolfman> those kids are the community LUL
[2:39:56] <mayorrev> GO TO THE MEAT SQUARE
[2:39:57] <AncelDeLambert> Good, good utz
[2:40:04] <shinsolaire96> m e a t
[2:40:11] <Inebriateddonut> The TOWER MEAT
[2:40:15] <+eshafferart> TOWER MEAT
[2:40:17] <shinsolaire96> p a t
[2:40:21] <+Kghaleon> I don't think the meat tower is there at night
[2:40:26] <+QuadraticGravity> THAT'S RIGHT
[2:40:46] <AncelDeLambert> it's in the Gara logs
[2:41:00] <shinsolaire96> I legit didnt know taht
[2:41:09] <+eshafferart> The orokin were masterful biological engineers- it's likely the meat is a sort of nanoculture made to rearrange parts of the tower or possibly keep data like a large brain
[2:41:13] <Slim_Lipid> The house butchers are unionized, unlike the Solaris
[2:41:18] <+alphonseisbest> bio organic tower pat
[2:41:18] <l0okaway> Ill show you my meat tower
[2:41:22] <AncelDeLambert> if you find the glass fish around Cetus you'll get more info on the tower and the town
[2:41:28] <+alphonseisbest> it heals back
[2:42:11] <AncelDeLambert> EARLY LUNCH FOR KONZU
[2:42:14] <+anar_bael> enough to feed the whole family and even the cousins too
[2:42:15] <Inebriateddonut> Konzu needs his lunch EARLY
[2:42:25] <+Boscuito> 3 am

[2:43:13] <Inebriateddonut> That wasn't there before
[2:43:36] <+Kghaleon> not yet
[2:43:46] <+SuichiTanaka> He doesn't see it cause he's not the leader of the team

[2:46:53] <AncelDeLambert> Shut up, Onko, we talk later!
[2:46:56] <VritraReiRei> @FadingEmber i thought thats every stream Kappa
[2:47:07] <+alphonseisbest> pat he killing on the way there go back Pat!
[2:47:08] <+IIIShrikeIII> you can't borrow an archwing from another player anymore?
[2:47:12] <+FadingEmber> @Inebriateddonut Thank you. Please never say tht again.
[2:47:16] <SulfurousAcid> hey Pat, how do you tell what level enemies you should be able to take on?
[2:47:32] <+Harawanagangsta> wheres PeePee?
[2:47:40] <+babrukus> Pffhahaha fuckin' love equinox on low level dudes
[2:47:45] <Inebriateddonut> @FadingEmber what, big space doll dick?
[2:47:45] <+Harawanagangsta> Not much of a warframe Stream without tha babey
[2:47:45] <riantDeliration> small floating head friends
[2:47:50] <+QuadraticGravity> @SulfurousAcid By how much damage you do to them, usually
[2:48:01] <+FadingEmber> why are you like thi?!
[2:48:09] <+SuichiTanaka> Warframe is weird in that you don't really have traditional "levels". Instead, it's just whatever you can handle.
[2:48:14] <+QuadraticGravity> Tell him he can bullet jump UPWARDS
[2:48:17] <riantDeliration> honestly theres no numerical way to tell if you can handle something that I've found, just try it and if you can't do it come back alter
[2:48:28] <SulfurousAcid> I see
[2:48:34] <+OceanGovernor> You could look at your frames mods levels and weapon levels vs the enemy level as a rough guide
[2:48:38] <+gutlesscoward> HOORAY
[2:48:40] <+legendfather_of_giants> or break the shit out of your build
[2:48:50] <+SuichiTanaka> If you get the right frames, guns, and mods, you can handle stuff WAY beyond your assumed "level".
[2:49:03] <+QuadraticGravity> Just aim up
[2:49:07] <+alphonseisbest> go in the cave
[2:49:09] <Inebriateddonut> Bullet jump up by aiming down or up
[2:49:09] <+BestTeaMaker> your bullet jump's direction
[2:49:09] <+Boscuito> if you get one good gun at a low level it can kill stuff like
[2:49:12] <+BestTeaMaker> is based on your cursor
[2:49:14] <+BestTeaMaker> so point up
[2:49:14] <+Boscuito> level 40-50 no problem
[2:49:18] <+BestTeaMaker> and you will bullet jump up
[2:49:21] <+Boscuito> (the hek)
[2:49:32] <+alphonseisbest> yep
[2:49:33] <+gutlesscoward> you bullet jump wherever you're aiming
[2:49:35] <+IIIShrikeIII> just press M
[2:49:45] <+OceanGovernor> Warframes cant swim
[2:49:49] <faegbeard> the panic
[2:50:11] <+OceanGovernor> Pat FREESWORD
[2:50:12] <+BestTeaMaker> @AngriestPat you can show them fortuna
[2:50:18] <grayjammer> except when they can
[2:50:19] <+Boscuito> why cant warframe crawl
[2:50:48] <l0okaway> Yo LevelClear, do you reckon you'll do a new podcast episode soon?
[2:50:52] <Mrbaconator> pants on the ground pants on the ground lookin like a FOOL with your pants on the ground
[2:50:58] <+QuadraticGravity> Not hold it
[2:50:58] <SummonerMagno> look for an eidolon
[2:51:05] <Inebriateddonut> just aim and dodge in a direction
[2:51:09] <+mitchteck> I think you can just go to forutuna and do the quest to get the hover board
[2:51:14] <Slim_Lipid> Warframes can't swim, but archwings can when they feel like it
[2:51:34] <+gutlesscoward> he has to aim too
[2:51:38] <+OceanGovernor> The warframe who turns into a puddle cannot swim
[2:51:43] <Inebriateddonut> It's a 4 directional dodge
[2:51:44] <+gutlesscoward> oh nevermind
[2:51:45] <AncelDeLambert> too bad this doesn't work on teh keyboard
[2:51:46] <+QuadraticGravity> Aim upwards when bullet jumping to go high up too
[2:51:47] <riantDeliration> i love the backflip and i didnt know it existed for like 2 years
[2:52:03] <+BestTeaMaker> show off fortuna!
[2:52:13] <+Imi09> A question chat, would you do PoE and Fortuna when you can or prioritise starchart progression?
[2:52:29] <+BestTeaMaker> prioritise starchart
[2:52:30] <+alphonseisbest> 99% damage pat..
[2:52:31] <Inebriateddonut> Prioritize starchart
[2:52:32] <+SuichiTanaka> Do the star chart ASAP
[2:52:34] <+BestTeaMaker> go do cetus/fortuna if you get bored
[2:52:37] <AncelDeLambert> get that main quest shit done
[2:52:39] <+BestTeaMaker> but super do the starchart first
[2:52:41] <+Javaa01> Do the starchart first
[2:52:41] <+OceanGovernor> You could do the Plains and Fortuna until you start getting one shot then go star chart
[2:52:44] <+gutlesscoward> star chart progression matters more, hte open-world stuff doesn't matter early
[2:52:47] <dsauce999> GRINDING OFFSCREEN
[2:52:50] <+anar_bael> fishing?
[2:52:51] <+mitchteck> Do the starting quests in there the. Do the starchart
[2:53:12] <+OceanGovernor> @LevelClear Ask Pat about the FREESWORD
[2:53:14] <+Imi09> Ok nice thanks chat!
[2:53:40] <Inebriateddonut> Pat you need to tell them about potatoes
[2:54:06] <riantDeliration> do not do Oro lmao
[2:54:10] <+SuichiTanaka> Potatoes should be for later, honestly
[2:54:30] <Inebriateddonut> But they need potatoes for power though and what if there's a potato alert?
[2:54:33] <+SuichiTanaka> You can type it into the Marketplace too
[2:54:33] <SummonerMagno> you can do it from market
[2:54:38] <faegbeard> from the market lad
[2:54:47] <+SuichiTanaka> Ahhh
[2:54:47] <+BestTeaMaker> PAT LOL
[2:54:49] <SummonerMagno> use code WoolieM for nothing
[2:54:50] <+BestTeaMaker> SPOILERS
[2:54:52] <+Kghaleon> Show him the spoilers
[2:54:52] <+SuichiTanaka> 'That' technique
[2:54:56] <+velemi> FUCK OFF PAT
[2:55:00] <Inebriateddonut> THAT's GOOD PAT
[2:55:02] <xeros720> ahaha, "close your eye, cover your ears, and hum to yourself for a minute"
[2:55:03] <+FadingEmber> Man, Pat loves explaining overly complicated things in convoluted ways
[2:55:16] <TalisKanju> Use Code "WoolieM" to have stuff TAKEN AWAY from you
[2:55:16] <mayorrev> what did he do
[2:55:20] <+IIIShrikeIII> lol privacy :D
[2:55:20] <+gutlesscoward> oh this'll be fun
[2:55:23] <+alphonseisbest> wow pat wow
[2:55:28] <+SuichiTanaka> Pat actually does a good job of explaining most things, but he just does it a bit too fast for a genuine newb to pick up
[2:55:36] <+velemi> LUL
[2:55:36] <+OceanGovernor> Use code "PatFuckBoivan" to steal from new players
[2:55:49] <+mitchteck> Oh boy is this what I think it is
[2:55:55] <TalisKanju> Type "Woolie" for lies
[2:55:58] <AncelDeLambert> oh dammit pat

[2:57:53] <mayorrev> doesnt Ember have a similar instakill AOE effect

[2:58:09] <Inebriateddonut> Ember's is sorta worse?
[2:58:10] <+BestTeaMaker> it's not instant and it's not as strong
[2:58:16] <Mrbaconator> warframe is NUMBER GO UP the space ninja MMO
[2:58:17] <+SuichiTanaka> Yeah, Ember's power is called 'World on Fire' guess what it does
[2:58:17] <SummonerMagno> ember: world on fire. equinox:maim

[3:11:33] <xeros720> switch boys making noise
[3:11:35] <swipperswapper> ah the flood
[3:11:43] <mayorrev> the song was worth it
[3:12:40] <xeros720> haha, my friend just handed me some sweet mods too, i'm so in
[3:12:41] <+SuichiTanaka> Warframe is the one game where I feel really good paying money to the devs
[3:12:41] <captainthunderwolf> They provide a high-enough quality product that people genuinely want to support it.
[3:12:48] <AncelDeLambert> MY EYES
[3:12:51] <captainthunderwolf> Crazy how not abusing your customers makes them support you.
[3:12:52] <riantDeliration> look at that STYLE
[3:12:53] <Croetec> Neon vomit
[3:13:01] <SaltyDongs> Is that an eva
[3:13:11] <+Harawanagangsta> paaat
[3:13:15] <+Harawanagangsta> stream something
[3:13:26] <SaltyDongs> He wont
[3:13:30] <dsauce999> DEEEEEPPPPP
[3:13:32] <swipperswapper> tell him if he does the intro quest for fortuna he gets the skateboard
[3:13:32] <+Harawanagangsta> you right
[3:13:33] <+Javaa01> And when Pat is possibly sleeping, read the wiki
[3:13:37] <+SuichiTanaka> He can go into the Codex to get some other tutorials
[3:13:40] <riantDeliration> some of the quests are pseudo-tutorials
[3:14:25] <Inebriateddonut> Put iron phoenix on!
[3:14:26] <SummonerMagno> put iron phoenix
[3:14:57] <+anar_bael> put zoom+ on your gun
[3:15:24] <SummonerMagno> he get halves
[3:15:25] <+Xravius> It will work, but you will get less bonus cash
[3:15:28] <+Xravius> Points
[3:15:29] <swipperswapper> pat it works just not optimally
[3:15:36] <+Boscuito> it still adds them
[3:15:39] <Inebriateddonut> It doesn't take any mod points at all
[3:15:39] <+Boscuito> just half as much
[3:15:41] <+alphonseisbest> it worked pat
[3:15:42] <SummonerMagno> still adds
[3:15:44] <swipperswapper> it just halves the points
[3:15:44] <+babrukus> yeah still adds them, just half as much
[3:15:46] <+BestTeaMaker> it still adds pat
[3:15:46] <+SuichiTanaka> Only stances/auras work like that
[3:15:46] <+legendfather_of_giants> still works pat
[3:15:47] <+BestTeaMaker> just half
[3:15:52] <+Boscuito> wrong again
[3:15:53] <Inebriateddonut> Pat stop being wrong
[3:16:01] <+anar_bael> crazy r
[3:16:04] <+BestTeaMaker> pat NotLikeThis
[3:16:06] <+Xravius> Being wrong and not reading
[3:16:07] <king_gar> the top mod is the only one that adds to ur mod slots!!!!
[3:16:15] <+OceanGovernor> Ha Pat that is wrong
[3:16:19] <+Xravius> It adds the points, but it's half
[3:16:20] <+Javaa01> Unmatching stances still give points
[3:16:21] <SummonerMagno> still works, just half efficiency
[3:16:23] <+OceanGovernor> Aura still gives half
[3:16:24] <+BestTeaMaker> it still adds points
[3:16:26] <Inebriateddonut> It doesn't subtract mod points! PAT YOU FUCK
[3:16:31] <+Boscuito> it adds points still at wrong polarity! just half as much!
[3:16:32] <OvercastKnot> crazy talk?
[3:16:33] <+BestTeaMaker> it stiiiilll aaaaadddds poooooooints
[3:16:37] <mayorrev> POTATOOO
[3:16:38] <+OceanGovernor> Where did you get the idea of subtracting mod points
[3:16:40] <Hiro01231> They always add
[3:16:46] <mayorrev> :potato: :potato: :potato: :potato: :potato:
[3:16:56] <AncelDeLambert> boil'em boil'em boil'em
[3:17:10] <+Xravius> It looks like a dolphin head
[3:17:14] <mayorrev> MASH EM
[3:17:16] <mayorrev> BOIL EM
[3:17:17] <faegbeard> PO TAT
[3:17:21] <mayorrev> STICK EM IN A STEW
[3:17:22] <+anar_bael> INFINITE POWER = shove a potato in it
[3:17:27] <+SuichiTanaka> There's a quest that even CALLS it a potato
[3:17:31] <GarrisonArmory> I like to dress up my potatoes
[3:17:36] <+babrukus> yeah just trade stuff for plat and use that to potato
[3:17:39] <+Boscuito> (or farm)
[3:17:47] <swipperswapper> all of this is farmable
[3:17:53] <+anar_bael> jigsaw parts
[3:18:04] <swipperswapper> not necessarily p2w
[3:18:21] <+SuichiTanaka> There's no way they're absorbing all of this
[3:18:26] <SummonerMagno> you often get potato alerts after every devstream
[3:18:28] <xeros720> i'd argue that frame and weapon slots are necessary though
[3:18:38] <+legendfather_of_giants> there's a guy on the reddit who forms his mk1 Bratton 43 times
[3:18:46] <fruit_pie_the_magician> IM THE SAME MASTERY AS PAT AND I NEVER SPENT SHIT
[3:18:47] <+OceanGovernor> Potent Orokin Tactical Technical Augmentation and Tactical Offensive device
[3:18:50] <swipperswapper> paging u/forma_addict
[3:18:53] <+OceanGovernor> POTATO
[3:18:56] <SummonerMagno> nitani!
[3:18:56] <+Boscuito> NITAIN ALERT
[3:19:01] <+Boscuito> ALART ALART
[3:19:07] <xeros720> AHHH, what's with these good alerts?
[3:19:31] <+Javaa01> The tutorial has only just begun
[3:19:32] <+Xravius> When in doubt, buy platinum
[3:19:35] <SulfurousAcid> where do you go to buy slots
[3:19:35] <+Xravius> Buy the space hats
[3:19:42] <+Javaa01> There's still about 50 hours of tutorial left
[3:19:47] <shinsolaire96> PS4 gang
[3:19:59] <SummonerMagno> stance and aura mods will never sustract capacity, it only adds hald the capacity
[3:20:00] <+OceanGovernor> @LevelClear you can enter a code in the Market for a free sword using code FREESWORD
[3:20:03] <SaltyDongs> yay mission successful
